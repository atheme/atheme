  Add get_source_name(), get_source_mask() and get_oper_name().
  These generate a name for a sourceinfo.
  The general idea is that get_source_name() and
  get_oper_name() are just a nick in the normal case
  where the user is logged in to an account with the
  same name as their nick, and get_source_mask() is
  nick!user@vhost. Somewhat longer results apply in
  other cases.

  Change the introduce_nick protocol function from
  (char *nick, char *ser, char *host, char *real, char *uid)
  to (user_t *u).
  This simplifies the code slightly and makes it possible
  to send more information about services in a clean way.
  For example, the nickTS sent out is now consistent with
  our record of it.

  Add two extra parameters to pcommand_add(), the minimum
  number of parameters and the allowed source types
  (before SERVER, user, server).
  Violations of this are logged at INFO level and the
  m_function is not called. So most code that checks
  for user/server or parc can be removed from m_functions
  (later commit).
  This facility should only be used for protocol violations,
  not things that can legitimately happen.
  This commit also repairs solidircd m_svhost().

  Log:
  Add operserv rwatch, a list of regular expressions all
  connecting clients are matched against. Matching clients
  are described in the snoop channel and/or klined.
  All subcommands require user:auspex privilege, enabling or
  disabling klines additionally requires operserv:massakill.
  All changes are snooped, changes to kline are also sent over
  wallops. There is also full logging.
  Loading this module (as well as clones) with /os modload
  may cause strange errors about loading other modules,
  I will fix this later.

  returned for a match, non-zero otherwise. The code is
  mostly taken from ratbox but modified to eliminate OS
  dependency for IPv6.
  CIDR is checked whether the ircd supports it or not.
  ChanServ RECOVER used to only check host and vhost matches

  Remove dictionary_set_compare_func() and instead take the
  comparison function from an extra argument to
  dictionary_create(). This prevents run-time changes to
  the comparison function possibly causing duplicates
  and crashes, and forces the user to think about the
  comparison function when creating a dictionary tree.
  CTCPs are now properly case sensitive.

  Postpone actual signal handling to the end of the main loop,
  functions like stdio, malloc, expire_check, db_save are
  not safe from signals. The signal handler just sets a
  variable.
  Exception is SIGUSR1 (out of memory) as we cannot safely
  return from there. So there we try (in a hackish way) to
  notify the network and log files (using write(2)) and
  abort(3) the process.

  Log:
  Make it possible for a module init function to indicate failure
  (m->mflags = MODTYPE_FAIL). If this happens the module will be
  unloaded without calling the deinit function.
  Added a macro MODULE_USE_SYMBOL to call module_locate_symbol()
  and abort the module load on failure.
  Other changes: the loaded module is now not in the modules list
  when modinit is called, wallops/log for depending modules unload
  in reverse order.

  improves compatibility and omits redundant type C modes.
  There is no possibility for tracking pending modes for
  multiple channels anymore, with a 0 second timeout this
  seems only really useful for dreamforge-style ircds,
  which are obsolete.
  There is quite a lot of debug output; this can be removed
  later. The API is still the ugly cmode() thing, I plan
  to replace that by something more sensible.

  Log:
  Remove the broken nickname linking system.
  
  Rationale:
  
  The implementation doesn't really work right, links basically only
  work for channel access and /ns ghost. Still it complicates things
  quite a lot.
  
  Considering we have identify as, and changing nicks does not log you
  out from services, the only use for nickname linking is allowing
  people to /ns ghost multiple nicks under one account. For that, they
  could also create multiple accounts instead (which requires keeping them
  all in use).
  
  Another argument is that, in practice, many people do not understand how
  linking works, so they don't use it.
  
  So I propose removing nickname linking.
  
  Multiple nicks per account might come back later with a
  ratbox-services-style nickserv (account name has no relationship to
  nicks, account has zero or more nicks associated with it).

  Add per-channel flags templates. Templates can be specified
  in the flags command, avoiding the need to memorize
  complicated flags strings. Templates are manipulated with
  the TEMPLATE command which is similar to the FLAGS command.
  The xOP levels can also be used as templates.
  
  For example: /msg chanserv flags #chan *!*@*.good.com VOP
  
  All template entries must fit in a single metadata entry,
  private:templates. This is fairly ugly string manipulation.
  
  The TEMPLATE command module needs to be enabled in the
  configuration file.

Prevents the following attack: malicious user registers evil1 with e-mail address innocent@user.com, uses /NS SET EMAIL evil@evil.com, and then uses the key to verify the initial registration (instead of the subsequent e-mail change). If we add more verification points in the future, we may want to have a 'key type' property.
