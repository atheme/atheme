  Don't let users change their e-mail address before they perform the initial verification. Prevents the following attack: malicious user registers evil1 with e-mail address innocent@user.com, uses /NS SET EMAIL evil@evil.com, and then uses the key to verify the initial registration (instead of the subsequent e-mail change). If we add more verification points in the future, we may want to have a 'key type' property.
