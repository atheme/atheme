Atheme Services 7.3 Development Notes
=====================================

There have been various changes since the last non-point release, most of which
are not documented here yet.

GUARANTEED COMPATIBILITY BREAKAGE
---------------------------------

- The `loadmodule` lines in the configuration file no longer take the
  "modules/" prefix. The example configuration file at
  `dist/atheme.conf.example` has been updated accordingly.

  So, if you currently have: `loadmodule "modules/nickserv/cert";`
  Then you will need to change this to: `loadmodule "nickserv/cert";`

  This can be done en masse with a `sed(1)` invocation on your configuration
  file. Please take a backup first:

  ```
  $ cp atheme.conf atheme.conf.bak
  $ sed -r -i -e 's|^loadmodule "modules/|loadmodule "|g' atheme.conf
  ```

POTENTIAL COMPATIBILITY BREAKAGE
--------------------------------

- Services now accepts nicknames up to 50 characters in length, because some
  IRCds like Charybdis do (if so configured). However, if you actually *use*
  nicknames on your network greater than *31* characters, your database WILL
  NOT be compatible with earlier versions of this software (<= 7.2). PLEASE
  consider this VERY CAREFULLY! This closes issue #601.

- The POSIX password crypto module has been removed. If you used this module on
  Atheme <= 7.2, this module has been replaced with 4 other modules (2 of which
  provide compatibility for the removed module). The module you need to load
  depends upon the operating system Atheme was being used on; if it was Mac OS
  then you need to load `crypto/crypt3-des` instead. If it was any other
  operating system, then you need to load `crypto/crypt3-md5` instead. Note
  that these 2 modules are compatibility modules; they can only verify existing
  encrypted passwords, they cannot encrypt new ones. You must load an
  encryption-capable crypto module. Please see the Password Hashing Modules
  section of `dist/atheme.conf.example`.

- If you (still) use legacy password crypto (verify-only) modules (`anope-*`,
  `base64`, `crypt3-des`, `crypt3-md5`, `ircservices`, `raw*`), then you MUST
  pass the `--enable-legacy-pwcrypto` flag to `./configure`, or these modules
  will NOT be compiled or installed. The presence of this flag can be confirmed
  at the bottom of the `configure` output; "Legacy Crypto Modules".

- The `nickserv/cracklib` module has been renamed to `nickserv/pwquality`
  because it is now capable of using `libpasswdqc` as well. The corresponding
  configuration item `nickserv::cracklib_warn` has been renamed to
  `nickserv::pwquality_warn_only` too.

- The `gameserv/happyfarm` module has been removed, as it was never completely
  finished and never worked anyway. Please remove this module from your
  configuration file, regardless of the version of services you are using.

- The `operserv/override` module has been removed. It did not provide
  sufficient transparency to users while providing a great potential for abuse.
  Additionally, it caused crashes if used with certain commands. Any legitimate
  use of this module should be possible to replace with a more specific command
  (such as `chanserv/fflags`). If you encounter a use case that cannot be
  replaced, please report a bug to let us know.

- The `operserv/set` module has been broken up into individual modules.
  Existing loadmodule configurations will continue to work, but you will
  receive a module deprecation warning if you load it. Please see the
  `dist/atheme.conf.example` file for the new submodule names.

- The `operserv/modinspect`, `operserv/modload`, `operserv/modreload` and
  `operserv/modunload` modules have been removed, and replaced with a single
  module `operserv/modmanager`. Please migrate your configuration if you were
  previously using any of these 4 modules, and rely upon the `operserv::access`
  configuration block to restrict usage of commands if you were e.g. previously
  running without `operserv/modload` loaded.

- The NickServ DROP command no longer requires the user's account password as
  an argument.

- Configuration options for all crypto modules have now been merged into a
  single top `crypto {}` block. Please see `dist/atheme.conf.example` for how
  to adapt your current crypto module configuration, if any.

- The `crypto/pbkdf2` module has been made verify-only, as it has been
  superseded by `crypto/pbkdf2v2`. Migration instructions are located in the
  `crypto {}` section comments in `dist/atheme.conf.example`. This module *is*
  still compiled and installed by default; it is *not* considered a legacy
  module for the purposes of `./configure --enable-legacy-pwcrypto` (above)
  because it does not use weak cryptographic primitives.

- The `crypto/argon2d` module has been removed, and replaced with a more
  generic `crypto/argon2` module that links against `libargon2` and supports
  more features, including pseudo-threading and different subtypes (Argon2i
  and Argon2id) too. If you were using this module on version 7.2, please see
  the `dist/atheme.conf.example` file for migration instructions. The names of
  the configuration options have changed! You will need libargon2 available at
  configure-time (`--with-argon2`).

- Services' `MU` & `MN` lines in the database (registered accounts & grouped
  nicknames) last seen times are now written as 0 if they are currently logged
  in, rather than using the current timestamp. The commit timestamp is written
  to the database as well, to allow services to reconstruct the last seen
  timestamps when it is restarted. This is to put less load on incremental
  backup systems, as the overwhelming majority of changes to each such line
  were always just the last seen timestamps. These changes break compatibility
  with previous versions of this software; so if you wish to downgrade your
  version of services after using this version, you will need to edit the
  database before it will start successfully. A migration script is located in
  this repository; please see the comment block in `contrib/database-ts.pl`.

- The service oper privilege previously called `user:regnolimit` has been
  changed to `user:exceedlimits`, and `user:regnolimit` now refers to the
  ability to use the nickserv command `REGNOLIMIT`.

Security
--------
- Services now accepts email addresses that may contain shell metacharacters.
  If your `mta` setting points at a shell script, please ensure that it
  properly handles email addresses with special characters in them.

- Services will now refuse to encrypt new passwords with older compatibility
  modules. You must load an encryption-capable password crypto module if you
  want new user registrations and changed passwords to be encrypted; you will
  receive an error message every time encryption is attempted if you do not.
  Please see `dist/atheme.conf.example` and the Password Cryptography section
  below for more information.

- When generating passwords on behalf of users (e.g. NickServ RESETPASS),
  services now allows you to configure the password's length.

- Services will now refuse to run as root.

- Services no longer prints plaintext passwords back to you for NickServ
  `SETPASS` and `SET PASSWORD`. This allows IRC client password redaction
  (where supported, e.g. in WeeChat) to achieve its purpose of preventing the
  user's account password from persisting in on-disk log files.

- Services will now automatically invalidate SETPASS tokens after a successful
  login.

- Services now has a much more rigorous random number generation interface
  and will e.g. refuse to use `arc4random(3)` unless we are actually on
  OpenBSD (which is the only platform that uses a secure algorithm for it).
  Support for libsodium random number generation was added, and the new
  preferred order for random number generation frontends (which can be over-
  ridden by an argument to `./configure`) is:

  - OpenBSD `arc4random(3)`, or
  - libsodium `randombytes(3)`, or
  - OpenSSL `RAND_bytes(3)`, or
  - ARM mbedTLS `hmac_drbg_random(3)` with SHA2-512, or
  - ARM mbedTLS `hmac_drbg_random(3)` with SHA2-256, or
  - Internal ChaCha20-based Fallback RNG, seeded by
    - `getentropy(3)`, or
    - `getrandom(2)`, or
    - `urandom(4)`

SASL
----
- SASLServ and its modules have been almost entirely re-written
- Advertise SASL mechanism list to UnrealIRCd servers
- Use a parameter vector to allow an arbitrary number of S2S arguments
- Indicate whether the client is on a plaintext connection or not.
  - This can be used by user_can_login hooks.
- Add support for SASL SCRAM logins (see `doc/SASL-SCRAM`)
- Add support for Curve25519 ECDH-based challenge-response logins
  - This is a private SASL mechanism that does not have widespread client
    support yet, but it is expected to eventually replace the older
    `ECDSA-NIST256P-CHALLENGE` mechanism, due to concerns within the
    cryptographic community about the safety of the NIST curves.
  - A complete mechanism documentation, including the protocol, and a design
    rationale, is located in `modules/saslserv/ecdh-x25519-challenge.c`. This
    will enable client authors to integrate the functionality into their IRC
    clients.
  - A tool, `atheme-ecdh-x25519-tool`, is provided (and is installed into
    `bin/` by `make install`) to enable users to generate private keys, obtain
    their public keys in base64 format (to pass to `NickServ SET`), encode
    keypairs as a QR-Code (should mobile clients end up implementing this
    functionality, and users wish to easily transfer their private keys), and
    serve as a reference tool to generate server challenges, and responses to
    server challenges, for client authors to verify their implementations
    against. Note that the QR-Code printing support requires a UTF-8-capable
    terminal emulator, with a monospace font supporting Unicode box-drawing
    characters.
  - If you wish to build and install the tool without building and installing
    everything, simply execute the following commands in the source directory:
    - `./configure --with-libmowgli=no`
    - `make libathemecore`
    - `make -C libathemecore/ install`
    - `make -C src/ecdh-x25519-tool/ install`
    - `~/atheme/bin/atheme-ecdh-x25519-tool -h`

MemoServ
--------
- MemoServ: let user know when their inbox is full
- Request: Add silent rejection feature and no subsequent requests feature
  - This will be useful on networks that have a bot to handle vhost requests
    automatically. Please see the `HELP` output for `REJECT`, and the comments
    on the `no_subsequent_requests` option in `dist/atheme.conf.example`.

ChanServ
--------
- Save `PUBACL` flag to database so it isn't lost when services restarts
- Add `default_mlock` option to adjust the default MLOCK value, similar
  to the existing `contrib/mlocktweaker` module

NickServ
--------
- Port `contrib/ns_waitreg` to `nickserv/waitreg`
- Port `contrib/ns_listlogins` to `nickserv/listlogins`
- Blame a specific channel when a NickServ `REGAIN` fails due to a channel ban
- NickServ `RETURN` now enables the `HIDEMAIL` flag if the email was changed
  (unless the flag is unset by default)

IRCds
-----
- Support `chm_nonotice.so` (Block channel notices) extension in charybdis IRCd
- Support cmode +M in charybdis (and make it oper-only)
- Support cmode +T in UnrealIRCd
- Support cmode +D in UnrealIRCd 4
- Add protocol module for ChatIRCd 1.1.x
- Check for NULL send/receive password on connection to IRCd

Misc
----
- Replace Base-64 codec to fix erroneous failures and add a raw encoder
- `dist/atheme.conf.example`: document `SET NOPASSWORD` module
- Services will no longer begin a new database unless passed the `-b` option
- Make the OperServ `MODLIST` command available to everyone
- Document the `special:authenticated` privilege
- Add a Turkish translation

Build System
------------
- `m4/`: don't check for warning flags that `gcc -Wall` enables
- `m4/`: don't check for warning flags that `gcc -Wextra` enables
- `m4/`: check for more warning flags
- `m4/`: support `clang`'s `-Weverything` flag
- `m4/atheme-libtest-*.m4`: ensure most called functions are actually linkable
- `m4/atheme-libtest-*.m4`: use pkg-config to look for libraries where possible
- `configure`: don't venture outside the build directory for headers if
  using the in-tree libmowgli-2 submodule
- `configure`: Detect PCRE support automatically instead of requiring the
  user to ask us to build against it (`--with-pcre`)
- `buildsys.mk.in`: clearly indicate link output file for `make V=1` text
- Makefiles: remove PCRE `CFLAGS` and `LIBS` from programs that don't use it
- Makefiles: separate `LDFLAGS` from `LIBS`
- Makefiles: build source files in alphabetical order
- Makefiles: tidy up everything and document authorship
- `configure`: conditionally compile `libathemecore/qrcode.c`
- `configure`: add `--with(out)-qrencode` flag to allow controlling detection
- `configure`: Make `--enable-ssl` now `--with-openssl` to match libmowgli
- `configure`: If `--with-openssl`, only build against libcrypto, not libssl
- `configure`: cleanly separate `CFLAGS` from `CPPFLAGS`
- `configure`: don't add `MOWGLI_CFLAGS` and `MOWGLI_LIBS` twice
- `configure`: print expanded directories
- `configure`: print final configuration in a nicer, grouped, format
- `configure`: print `CC`/`CFLAGS`/`CPPFLAGS`/`LD`/`LDFLAGS`
- `configure`: indicate if `--enable-warnings` was given
- `configure`: detect support for `-Wl,-z,relro`, `-Wl,-z,now`, `-Wl,--as-needed`
- `configure`: don't link everything against `-lcrypt`
- `configure`: add `--enable-compiler-sanitizers` flag for ASan, UBSan, etc.
- Update third-party files (`ABOUT-NLS`, `autoconf/*`, `m4/*.m4`)
- Fix building contrib modules on non-Linux machines
- Clarify that `GIT-Access` is a file by renaming it to `GIT-Access.txt`

Password Cryptography
---------------------
- The existing crypto modules no longer need OpenSSL (or any crypto library)
- Add support for scrypt password encryption with `crypto/scrypt`.
  The scrypt module requires libsodium (`--with-sodium`).
- Add support for bcrypt password encryption with `crypto/bcrypt`.
- `libathemecore/crypto.c`: log current crypto provider on mod(un/re)load
- `libathemecore/crypto.c`: rip out plaintext fallback implementation
- Make old modules (`ircservices`, `pbkdf2`, `rawmd5`, `rawsha1`) verify-only
  - If you are still using pbkdf2, it is recommended to migrate to pbkdf2v2.
  - A migration script is included in the contrib/ directory.
- Add verify-only `rawsha2-256` and `rawsha2-512` modules to verify more
  password hashes from other sources.
- Warn admin if no encryption-capable crypto modules are loaded
- Services will now refuse to set new account passwords if they cannot be
  encrypted, and refuse new account registrations if the password cannot be
  encrypted. You MUST load an encryption-capable crypto provider.
- Generating new encrypted passwords is now much more efficient
- Try encrypting a password with each module in turn instead of giving up
- Indicating whether a password needs re-encrypting is now much more efficient
- Verifying a password hash no longer wastes CPU time on modules that didn't
  produce it if the module that did produce it fails to verify it
- A new core module `operserv/genhash` is available to generate password hashes
  suitable for use as services operator passwords. This alleviates the need to
  build contrib module support and use `contrib/ns_generatehash`.
- The `crypto/posix` module has been replaced with individual `crypt3-*` modules.
  Please see the Password Hashing Modules section of `dist/atheme.conf.example`.
- Legacy password crypto modules are now not compiled or installed by default.

  accountname.

Atheme Services 6.0 Release Notes
=================================
All bugfixes from the 5.2 branch of Atheme are also in 6.0.

ircd protocol
-------------
- inspircd: Support for owner, halfops and admin are now dynamically
  enabled by what modes exist instead of being enabled by what modules
  you have loaded in inspircd.
- support for InspIRCd 1.1, OfficeIRC and UltimateIRCd 3 has been removed.

opensex
-------

  against.
- new set_prefix module. This module allows channels to define a channel-specific 
  fantasy prefix. The channel-specific prefix is displayed in the INFO for the
  channel. This is particularly useful if the channel uses an external bot that
  conflicts with the services default fantasy prefix.
- new clear_flags module. This allows founders to remove all entries from the
  channel access list except other founders.

groupserv
---------
- new service that allows users to form groups of accounts and apply the
  same ACL entries to them, send memos to them and other features.

helpserv
--------
- new service that allows users to request oper help in different ways.
  Currently either via a ticket system or by "pinging" the opers with a
  request for help.

hostserv
--------
- allow activating or rejecting all waiting vhosts by using '*' instead of
  a nick.
infoserv
--------
- oper-only message support. You can now give messages an importance where
  they will only be sent to opers upon oper-up.
- in infoserv message subjects, underscores will now be replaced with spaces
  so you can have multi-word subjects.
- allow customizing the number of infoserv messages shown to users on connect.

--------
- new contrib module, ns_waitreg that allows you to specify how long a user must
  be connected before they can register a nick.

operserv
--------
- new readonly module. This allows changing the readonly state at runtime.

xmlrpc
------
- the legacy xmlrpc/account, xmlrpc/channel and xmlrpc/memo modules have been
  removed. These have been deprecated for over 4 years and you should be
  using xmlrpc/main and atheme.command for all your xmlrpc uses.
- the xmlrpc core has been rewritten a little bit to use mowgli's patricia tree
  code.  this should bring a performance improvement over the hashtable code it
  was using.
- xmlrpc has been completely moved out of core
- a new command, atheme.privset has been added to get the soper privs of a user.

code
----
- default values in config options are now supported. This is particularly
  useful in modules and cleans up the config code a bit.

- the flags code has been cleaned up to assume that there is only one flags
  table.
- the flags code is now extendable by modules.
- mychan_pick_candidate() is now in the public API.

  doesn't support ipv6 - you suck.
- ctcp handling has been rewritten.
- new easter egg.
- the shrike hash function (shash()) has been removed as there was no longer
  anything using it.
- the "symbolmatrix" code was removed because we went with a different solution
  instead long ago.
- myuser_t is now a child of myentity_t which describes an entity that can have
  channel membership.
- list_t/node_t have been removed in preference of mowgli.list.
- balloc has been removed in preference of mowgli.heap.

other
-----
- added an anope 1.9.2 flatfile DB to OpenSEX DB conversion script.
- mail sending has been changed, likely causing serverinfo::mta scripts to
  break. The command is now passed "-t" rather than the email address and
  the shell is no longer used.
- the SDK hg revision of modules in now shown in MODINSPECT.

Atheme Services 5.2 Release Notes
=================================
Note: We are looking for additional developers to help with maintenance of

- made the request system (specifically the ACTIVATE command) not send
  a memo to the user.

infoserv
--------

--------
- split out SET into seperate modules for each SET command. nickserv/set
  is now a "meta-module" that depends on all the set_* modules.

  the user or disallow them from registering with a configuration option.
- added ns_generatehash contrib module to generate a password hash for
  a soper if you have crypto enabled.
- removed ns_ratelimitreg contrib modules as its functionality is now in
  core.

other
-----
- ircservtoatheme: generally make a bit more robust.
- added ratelimiting support to hostserv/request, chanserv/register and

  from another. See the example config for details. Note, you can have two
  operclasses with the same privledges, so extending is not forced.

  been changed slightly to make this possible.
- Report other nicks of deleted accounts to snoop and log file.
- Add operserv/greplog module (from freenode modules) to allow searching
  through recent logs from IRC.
- Automatically rehash after loading modules that need a rehash.

------
- Fix atheme.memo.ignore.list and atheme.memo.ignore.clear to require only
  two arguments (third wasn't ever in use). **[MERGED]**

- Fix null pointer dereference with some invalid config files.
- Move the metadata entries to object_t.

  move some generic TS6 and P10 stuff into common modules.
- Rename CMODE_OP and the like to CSTATUS_*, emphasizing that they are
  separate from simple modes.
- Use C99 booleans (<stdbool.h>, bool, true, false).

other

- Fix running on MacOS X 10.5.
- Fix compilation sometimes using system include files in place of our own.
- Change the default for gettext (NLS) to disabled in the setup script.

  Also make it handle +i channels more effectively.
- Allow admins to change oper only modes in mlocks even without +s flag.
- Snoop changes to oper only modes in mlocks.
- Split DROP into DROP (users) and FDROP (admins).

- Support join throttling (+j) in bahamut and solidircd.
- Make /os jupe work on existing servers for ircds using unconnect semantics

Atheme 2.1 Release Notes
========================

ircd protocol
-------------
- The inspircd11 protocol module now sends wallops as server notices
  and no longer needs m_globops.so (but still uses it if loaded).
- When sending a notice to a channel as a server notice (because the
  service is not on channel and the ircd would not allow the notice),
  prepend it with "[<service>:<channel>] " instead of "<service>: "
- Clean up handling of services deopped on channels.

nickserv
--------
- Add nickname grouping, this allows users to register multiple nicks
  to one account. The GROUP and UNGROUP commands add and remove additional
  nicks. Additional nicks expire separately from the main account. Admins
  can use FUNGROUP to remove additional nicks from any account.
- The ACCESS ADD command now converts masks like 1.2.3.* to CIDR masks
  instead of rejecting them.
- Add LISTVHOST command.
- Make the gen_vhostonreg contrib module also generate a valid (although
  ugly) vhost for account names which contain characters not valid in
  hostnames.
- Add user_info hook, allows modules to add things to /ns info.
- Show ENFORCE status in /ns info (to all users).
- Snoop notices for registrations now show the source name explicitly
  if appropriate.

- Remove rate limiting for users with general:flood privilege.

chanserv
--------

  matching the template with a template change, by prefixing a flag
  change with an '!'.
- Add SYNC command to contrib, makes channel status agree with flags.
- Add FFLAGS command, allows opers to force a flags change on any channel.
- On newly registered channels, only mlock -l if no limit is set
  and only mlock -k if no key is set.
- Show channel email address in INFO.
- Add chanserv::trigger option, allows changing the '!' in fantasy commands
  to something else. The special case for '.flags' has been removed.
- Add SET GUARD, allows toggling whether ChanServ joins the channel on a
  per-channel basis. The general::join_chans option determines whether
  SET GUARD can be used.
- Make the WHY command show all flags.
- Allow using the xOP commands via non-IRC.
- Allow using SET as a fantasy command.
- Move help for /cs halfop to a separate help file.
- Make channel access entry metadata work. This allows modules to associate
  name/value pairs with channel access entries. There is currently no
  facility to read/write channel access entry metadata directly like there
  is for user and channel metadata.

oper
----
- Add /os soper, allows adding services operators at run time.
- Add operclass::needoper option, denies giving any privilege to IRC users
  matching this operclass who are not IRCops.
- Add some more log levels and generally clean up logging, for example
  allow disabling logging of all commands. Note that loglevel error logs
  much less now, use loglevel info for moderate logging.
- Add os_logonnews contrib module to send text to all connecting users.

code
----
- Remove irccmp() and ircncmp(). These functions were equivalent to strcmp()
  and strncmp(). IRC-style case-insensitive comparisons are irccasecmp() and
  ircncasecmp().
- Make clog unavailable outside libatheme/ and rename it. Other code should
  use slog(), logcommand(), etc. to log things.

documentation
-------------
- Add some missing help files.
- Clarify some things in the installation documentation.
- Add documentation for the SASL client protocol.

other
-----
- chanserv::changets is now shown as 't' in version replies
- Make --enable-fhs-paths also affect the location of the log file, data
  files and pid file. Note that for data files to work with
  --enable-fhs-paths, they need to use DATADIR instead of "etc".
- Add motd replacement &mynicks&.
- Fix various memory leaks.
- Add support for converting services operators, nickname access lists
  and nickname grouping in anope_convert.c.
- Using the postgresql backend is now officially discouraged; it will be
  removed in 2.2.x and newer.
- Remove socklen_t check from configure.

Atheme 2.0 Release Notes
========================

ircd protocol

- Support CIDR channel bans/exceptions and akills.
- Shut down if too many services are killed in one second.
- Handle SASL logins more cleanly.

nickserv
--------
- Move nickname enforcement module from contrib to modules. This forces
  nickname changes on users who do not identify to their nick.
- Add gen_vhostonreg module to contrib from atheme-modules, sets a vhost on
  new nick/account registrations.
- Make it possible for nickserv to act as userserv with the
  nickserv::no_nick_ownership config option and the nickserv/login module.
  Remove the old userserv which mostly consisted of a duplicate of nickserv.
- Add nickname access lists; users matching an u@h mask on the access list for
  a nick will not be warned to identify and will not be affected by nickname
  enforcement, and the last login time will be updated. Channel access will
  not be granted.
- Make /ns acc a bit more usable.

chanserv
--------
- Add TOPICLOCK flag, reverts topic changes by users who do not have +t flag.
- Store the channelTS of registered channels in the private:channelts metadata
  entry. This is used to make chanserv::changets nicer and to avoid KEEPTOPIC
  restores if the channel was not recreated.
- Also give VERBOSE notices on foundership changes.
- Fantasy and regular commands now use the same code. Fantasy commands are
  executed with VERBOSE set. This allows executing all chanserv commands
  affecting a single registered channel, except DROP and SET, as a fantasy
  command but removes some aliases.
- Allow /cs status when not logged in.
- Add /cs count from contrib, shows how many entries are in access lists.

oper
----
- Add a privilege operserv:massakill to control new commands that may
  do mass kills.
- Add /os clearchan, kicks, kills or klines all non-IRCops in a channel.
- Add /os compare, shows common channels of two users or common users in two
  channels.
- Add /os rmatch, shows all users matching a regular expression.
- Add /os rakill, bans all users matching a regular expression from the
  network.
- Add /os rnc, shows the most common realnames on the network.
- Add /os clones, watches the network for IPs with too many connections.
- Add operserv rwatch, a list of regular expressions all connecting clients
  are matched against. Matching clients are described in the snoop channel
  and/or klined.
- Add /stats B, shows hash statistics, requires general:auspex privilege.
- Add messages to the snoop channels about various things that used to
  generate wallops only; move some other things from wallops to snoops.
- Add /stats f, shows some information about open connections.

xmlrpc
------
- Clean up the HTTP protocol handling considerably.
- Allow pipelining multiple calls over one connection.
- Allow calling most services commands via XMLRPC.
- Allow passing a parameter (typically true source IP address) to various
  XMLRPC methods, which will be logged.

documentation
-------------
- Add a script to convert the help files to HTML.
- Make various help files clearer.

code
----
- Replace the old hashtables with a cleaner and more powerful dictionary tree
  implementation.
- Make 'make depend' work, this allows only recompiling what is necessary.
- Move around many things to different source files, hopefully making it
  easier to find things.
- Restrict visibility of some uplink-related declarations (uplink.h and
  pmodule.h no longer included by atheme.h).
- Add ability to run/build Atheme without the block allocator (for debugging).
- Change parameter type for the channel_join and channel_part hooks to
  hook_channel_joinpart_t *. This avoids ugliness when the first hook kicks
  out the user and the next uses freed memory.
- Rewrite much of the network I/O code.
- Pass less nicks and UIDs around in string form.
- Remove the win32 port, it was hopelessly broken and nobody cares about it.
- Add more comments about what various functions do.

other
-----
- Get rid of signal-related race conditions.
- Add DESTDIR support to the build system (allows installing to a different
  path than where we expect to run from).
- Add sorservices-compatible password encryption support.
- Various bugfixes and cleanups.

  with the new chanserv::changets config option (for charybdis, ratbox,
  hybrid, bahamut, solidircd).

  to be effective, see include/module.h.
- Add command line option -l to change the log file.
- Rewrite nickserv/userserv set command handling, allowing modules to
  provide extra set options.
- Merge modules/saslserv/sasl module into modules/saslserv/main. You should

Atheme 1.1 Release Notes
========================
- Shorten /msg chanserv/nickserv/userserv help, the full command list
  is on /msg *serv help commands.
- Add XMLRPC method atheme.channel.access.get.
- Disallow vhosts which are too long or contain @!*?
- Don't introduce a service with a UID if the ircd does not support UIDs
  when loading it at runtime.
- Change regex_match API to be more efficient.
- Disable modrestart, it cannot possibly work. (It used to crash.)
- Add wumpus, a service providing a game, to contrib.
- Add source of the message to hook_cmessage_data_t.
- Add optional new syntax for operclass{} blocks.
- Add SASL support, this allows users on charybdis networks to log in
  before registration to the network; among other things this ensures
  the real host behind a services vhost is not shown to nonopers.
- Add support for /motd <atheme>, uses PREFIX/etc/atheme.motd.
- Allow users to GHOST other nicks which are logged into their account.
- Allow other services than chanserv to process fantasy commands.
- Allow specification of akill duration in hours (h), days (d) and weeks (w).
- Add /os akill sync, sends all akills to all servers.
- Ultimate3 improvements.
- Add support for Nefarious IRCu 0.4.x or later.
- Several UserServ bugfixes.
- InspIRCd improvements.
- Ensure kline exempt fully exempts from akills; do not kill akilled users
  at any time.
- Avoid sending out klines with negative expiry time.
- Add IP glob akill matching, for ircds that send user IP addresses.
- Move akill checking to operserv/akill module.
- Don't allocate me.name/me.numeric on rehash. This fixes a known P10
  issue.
- Add support for ircu2.10.12's +D mode, which was already implemented
  in Asuka.
- Always send both the channel TS and the topic TS when setting a topic
  under P10 ircd's.
- Several other minor tweaks and bugfixes.


Atheme 1.0 Release Notes
========================
- Add ability to use =<nick> where accounts are used. (it aliases to the
  User's account).
- Deop users recreating registered channels if they do not have op flags.
  This attempts not to affect channels created longer ago.
- Add separate protocol module for ircd-hybrid, with CHGHOST support.
- Add ircd name to /version output.
- Add atheme.account.vhost XMLRPC for setting and removing vhosts. Note
  that this, unlike the other XMLRPCs, allows things that the given
  credentials would not normally (over IRC) be allowed to.
- Remove the incomplete and cluttering nickname linking system (this was
  actually done in 1.0rc1, but we forgot to mention it).
- Don't allocate me.name/me.numeric on rehash. This fixes a known P10
  issue.
- Add support for ircu2.10.12's +D mode, which was already implemented
  in Asuka.
- Always send both the channel TS and the topic TS when setting a topic
  under P10 ircd's.

Atheme 1.0rc1 Release Notes
===========================
- Add capabilities to protocol modules:
  - forced nick change (aka SVSNICK)
  - invite
  - channel op notice (aka WALLCHOPS)
- Don't unkline temp akills if they have already expired.
- AKILL wildcard checking changed to ratbox algorithm.
- Further simplification of access checking.
- Hostmask access entries now check vhost, not host. This means services
  cloaks now work in access lists.
- InspIRCd module updated to beta6 and above (tree linking instead of mesh).
- For akicks, use a matching +b'ed hostmask if possible.
- For ircds with dalnet-like +r umodes, don't set it for userserv.
- Add /cs forcexop to reset access levels to xOP values. Useful if CA_?OP
  are changed.
- Make CA_?OP configurable in atheme.conf.
- Add channel_info hook on /cs info.
- Add per-channel flags templates. Templates can be specified in the flags
  command, avoiding the need to memorize complicated flags strings.
  Templates are manipulated with the TEMPLATE command which is similar to the
  FLAGS command.  The xOP levels can also be used as templates.
- Add per-channel fantasy command disable.
- Fix NEVEROP and NOOP options.
- If fantasy commands are globally disabled, mark services clients as "deaf"
  for some ircds.
- Add /cs set verbose ops, works like /cs set verbose on but only shows to
  channel ops.
- Allow users to remove their own access from channels (except akicks of
  course).
- Some improvements to network I/O.
- Add support for permanent (+P) channels in charybdis/hyperion/shadowircd.
- Add support for more FHS-like paths (not really complete but should still
  be helpful for packagers).
- Add fine grained services operator privileges. IRCops get certain
  privileges, and registered accounts can be granted privileges. This
  works via atheme.conf. You will need to redo the operator part of your
  configuration. See the new example.conf and doc/PRIVILEGES for more
  information.
- Add message translation support.
- /cs voice/halfop/op now notifies the target user who did it.
- /cs flags mentions who gave the command in the verbose notice.
- Remove many redundant confirming notices.
- Regardless of join_chans/leave_chans, join chanserv temporarily to
  channels which would otherwise be empty to enforce akick or staffonly.
- Add nickserv enforcement (FNC users who do not identify in time) to
  contrib.
- Drastically improve P10 support.
- Add solidircd support.
- Add support for ban exceptions and other ban-like modes.
- Remove possibilities to log in to accounts without password by changing
  nick during a netsplit on an ircd that does not clear +r (or similar) on
  nick changes.
- Various minor tweaks and bugfixes.

Atheme 0.3 Release Notes
========================
- All services have been entirely modularized. You will need to
  redo your configuration. An authentication service has been
  added (choose from either NickServ or UserServ,) for
  UserServ you should use example.userserv.conf.
- The way modules work has been changed almost entirely. Please try
  loading bad modules especially on macintosh and AIX systems, thanks!
  (Report any negative findings to the tracker.)
- The way sockets work has also changed entirely. We'd love to know
  how well the new poll and kqueue code is working, and if there
  are any issues with it.
- Support for poll() and kqueue() have been added, please comment on
  performance differentials.
- Most static object structures are now described as metadata, please
  comment on how well this transition is working for you.
- PostgreSQL support is starting to freeze. Please note schema changes
  in SQL/atheme_init.sql.
- The build system has been reworked. You may need to use gmake on
  BSD systems. Please comment on any trouble you have had with building
  Atheme (on the tracker, of course.)
- protocol/hyperion supports login session tracking now, please comment
  on how well it is working for you.
- protocol/ratbox support for login sessions has also vastly improved.
- dbtool is most likely broken right now. This is not likely to change
  any time soon.
- The configuration parser has been overhauled. Please report any crashes
  when parsing configurations.
- Channel passwords have been removed.
- Most access checking has been simplified, please make sure it is working
  properly on your network.
- w00t has gone and entirely tokenized the Unreal protocol support. Please
  report any issues with this that you find.
- STATS is now abstracted instead of living in 15 different protocol modules.
- Probably much more that we have missed :)

Atheme 0.2 Release Notes
========================
- Way too many things to note.

Atheme 0.2rc1 Release Notes
========================
- Protocol support has been modularized.
- The configuration format has drastically changed. Please redo your config.
- The core has been modularized. Please provide feedback if something is not
  working as it should.
- Module support has been added. To compile third party modules, add them to
  the modules directory and rerun setup/configure. Any modules in your
  installation's modules/ directory will be automatically loaded at startup.
- Metadata support has been added. To experiment with it, see our wiki
  information on the topic:

  http://wiki.oscnet.org/index.php/Atheme:Experimenting_with_Metadata
- Several NickServ-related bugs have been fixed.
- IRCNet support is marked as experimental. If you run this ircd,
  please give us feedback on how well it functions.

Atheme 0.1 Release Notes
========================

- Dancer/Hyperion IRCd support is marked as experimental. If you run this ircd,
  please give us feedback on how well it functions.
- Chunky Monkey IRCd is also marked as experimental. If you run this ircd,
  please give us feedback on how well it functions.
- NickServ support is experimental. We would like suggestions on how to improve it.
  If you would like to use it, you should use the example-traditional.conf file,
  instead of the example.conf. This will set up a logical environment for NickServ to
  operate in.
- InspIRCd support passes our regression tests, however, we would like feedback
  concerning how well it works. Features added by optional modules are not supported
  at this time. You will need the m_services.so module loaded to make things work
  100% properly.
- UnrealIRCd support is implemented fairly well, but not all features are supported.
- Bahamut 1.8 support has not been tested against 1.8.4, though it is expected that
  1.8.4 should work fine.
- TSora IRCd support (ratbox) does not support TS6, and probably never will.
