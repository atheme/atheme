/*
 * These are the modules included with the core distribution of Services.
 *
 * You may be interested in the atheme community modules distribution as well,
 * which adds additional features that may or may not be compatible with the
 * project paradigms intended for maintainance of the core of atheme-services.
 *
 * Visit the atheme-services website for more information and to download
 * them.
 *
 * Modules marked [experimental] will taint your atheme-services instance. Do
 * not file any bug reports with us about using Services with those modules;
 * they will be ignored.
 *
 *
 *
 * Modules can be loaded in one of two ways. You can either pass the module
 * path as a string:
 *
 *   loadmodule "foo/bar";
 *   loadmodule "foo/baz";
 *
 * ... which is how it used to be done in previous versions of this software,
 * and how all of the loadmodule lines are listed in this file (for backward
 * compatibility). This is also the only way to load a module by absolute,
 * rather than relative, path.
 *
 * New in v7.3 is that you can use the module path to construct a series of
 * configuration blocks:
 *
 *   loadmodule {
 *     foo {
 *       bar;
 *       baz;
 *     };
 *   };
 *
 * ... which is equivalent to the individual two lines using strings above.
 * You can mix and match both styles in the same configuration file, but not
 * in the same directive. For example, this is valid:
 *
 *   loadmodule "foo/bar";
 *   loadmodule {
 *     baz {
 *       quux;
 *     };
 *   };
 *
 * ... while this is not valid:
 *
 *   loadmodule "foo/bar" {
 *     baz {
 *       quux;
 *     };
 *   };

 */
loadmodule "backend/opensex";



/* Password hashing modules.
 *
 * If you would like encryption for your services passwords, or to migrate
 * from another IRC services package which used encryption for its passwords,
 * please select a module here.
 *
 * The following encryption-capable crypto modules are available:
 *
 *   Argon2 (Password Hashing Competition 2015)     crypto/argon2
 *   scrypt (Tarsnap Online Backup Service)         crypto/scrypt
 *   PBKDF2 (Including support for SASL SCRAM-SHA)  crypto/pbkdf2v2
 *   bcrypt (EksBlowfish; from Niels Provos etc.)   crypto/bcrypt
 *   SHA2-512 crypt(3) a la '$6$...'                crypto/crypt3-sha2-512
 *   SHA2-256 crypt(3) a la '$5$...'                crypto/crypt3-sha2-256
 *
 * If you do not load an encryption-capable crypto module, some features will
 * not work correctly, and errors will be logged on e.g. user registration
 * that it was not possible to encrypt their password. Support for running
 * without an encryption-capable crypto module will be removed in a later
 * version of this software; for now it is just *HIGHLY* discouraged.
 *
 * Note, that upon starting with an encryption-capable crypto module, YOUR
 * UNENCRYPTED PASSWORDS ARE IMMEDIATELY AND *IRREVERSIBLY* CONVERTED. Make
 * at least TWO backups of your database before experimenting with this. If
 * you have several thousand accounts, this conversion may take a long time.
 *
 * The following modules can only be used to /verify/ existing encrypted
 * passwords, for example when upgrading from an older version of this
 * software, or migrating from something else:
 *
 *   PBKDF2 v1 (Atheme <= 7.2 compatibility)        crypto/pbkdf2
 *   Raw SHA2-512                                   crypto/rawsha2-512
 *   Raw SHA2-256                                   crypto/rawsha2-256
 *   Anope SHA2-256 (Anope 2.0 compatibility)       crypto/anope-enc-sha256
 *   Raw SHA1 (Anope ~1.8 compatibility)            crypto/rawsha1
 *   Raw MD5 (Anope ~1.8 compatibility)             crypto/rawmd5
 *   IRCServices (+ Anope) compatibility            crypto/ircservices
 *   MD5 crypt(3) (Atheme Linux compatibility)      crypto/crypt3-md5
 *   DES crypt(3) (Atheme OS X compatibility)       crypto/crypt3-des
 *   Base64 (Anope ~1.8 compatibility)              crypto/base64
 *
 * To transition between crypto schemes, load the preferred scheme first,
 * and as users login or set new passwords, they will be migrated to the new
 * preferred scheme. Like so:
 *
 * loadmodule "crypto/argon2";
 * loadmodule "crypto/scrypt";
 * loadmodule "crypto/pbkdf2v2";
 * loadmodule "crypto/pbkdf2";
 * loadmodule "crypto/crypt3-md5";
 *
 * The Argon2 module requires the argon2 reference library (./configure
 * --with-argon2) and is *NOT* available in Atheme v7.2 or earlier. If you
 * wish to use this module while retaining the possibility to downgrade to
 * v7.2, please see the crypto {} documentation below.
 *
 * The Scrypt module requires libsodium (./configure --with-libsodium) and is
 * *NOT* available in Atheme v7.2 or earlier. This module may also require a
 * 64-bit Operating System to function correctly.
 *
 * The PBKDF2v2 module has no dependencies and is recommended. If you were
 * previously using the PBKDF2 v1 module on v7.2, you must still keep it in
 * the configuration here; the PBKDF2 v2 module cannot verify its password
 * hashes. However, you should also load PBKDF2 v2 (if you don't decide to use
 * anything else), because the PBKDF2 v1 module is now verify-only.
 *
 * The bcrypt module will truncate passwords greater than 72 characters. It is
 * also capable of verifying the older $2a$ digests that contain an integer
 * wrap-around bug, as used on e.g. Anope. It is not capable of verifying the
 * PHP-bcrypt $2x$ and $2y$ digests; but $2y$ can simply be changed to $2b$.
 * All successfully-verified passwords not using $2b$ will be converted to it.
 * This is an encryption-capable module, but its use is discouraged unless you
 * need to use it for interoperability with some other piece of software.
 *
 * The crypt3-* modules depend on your platform crypt(3) supporting the
 * respective algorithms. This is not guaranteed to be the case. If you used
 * "crypto/posix" on Linux, you need "crypto/crypt3-md5". If you used
 * "crypto/posix" on OS X, you need "crypto/crypt3-des". These modules issue
 * informational messages when loaded to the effect that they might break in
 * the future. They also run selftests on load to verify that they will work.
 *
 * All available modules are listed below, in the preferred load order. The
 * modules that are commented out are not available by default (please see the
 * v7.3 release notes in NEWS.md) or may require a third-party library to use.
 * If you know that you do not need a specific module, it is better to not
 * load it, so comment it out. Do not change the order of the modules below
 * unless you need to migrate from one to the other (as described above); in
 * particular, putting verify-only modules above encryption-capable modules
 * would be a waste of CPU time every time password verification for a user
 * whose password was not encrypted by them is attempted.
 *
 * Comments that start with -- describe the ./configure option necessary to
 * have this module built.

 * SERVICES RUNTIME CONFIGURATION SECTION.                                  *
 ****************************************************************************/

/*
 * This block controls the configuration options for crypto modules.
 *
 * It is recommended to either leave the values at their defaults, or
 * experiment with them so that it takes approximately 0.2-0.4 seconds for
 * users to identify. Services blocks while the password is being encrypted or
 * verified, so don't set these too large, or people can hang services by
 * trying many password attempts at once.
 *
 * A benchmark program for the Argon2, scrypt & PBKDF2 crypto code is
 * available to assist with tuning these parameters:
 *
 *     - ./configure --prefix=foo ...
 *     - make
 *     - make install
 *     - ${foo}/bin/atheme-crypto-benchmark -o
 *
 * If you wish to deploy SASL SCRAM support, please read 'doc/SASL-SCRAM' and
 * pass the '-i' flag to the included cryptographic benchmarking utility too.
 *
 * If you are using the PBKDF2 module, its performance will be significantly
 * affected by your choice of cryptographic digest library. This software can
 * currently interface with 3 libraries; in decreasing order of performance:
 *
 *     - OpenSSL (libcrypto)
 *     - GnuPG (libgcrypt)
 *     - ARM mbedTLS (libmbedcrypto)
 *
 * If you have one of these libraries available at configure-time, the PBKDF2
 * module will perform significantly better, allowing you to raise its
 * iteration count without affecting the computation time. This is indicated
 * by the output of the configure script; "Digest Frontend". The benchmark
 * program will also inform you what cryptographic digest library it is using,
 * if any.
 *
 *
 *
 * If you are migrating from "crypto/argon2d" (v7.2) to "crypto/argon2", and
 * you wish to use the same parameters as the older module's defaults, to
 * retain the ability to downgrade services, configure it like so:
 *
 *     crypto {
 *         argon2_type = "argon2d";
 *         argon2_memcost = 14;
 *         argon2_timecost = 32;
 *         argon2_threads = 1;
 *         argon2_saltlen = 32;
 *         argon2_hashlen = 64;
 *     };
 *
 *
 *
 * If you are migrating from "crypto/pbkdf2" (v7.2) to "crypto/pbkdf2v2", and
 * you wish to use the same parameters as the older module, configure it like
 * so:
 *
 *     crypto {
 *         pbkdf2v2_digest = "SHA512";
 *         pbkdf2v2_rounds = 128000;
 *     };
 *
 * Note that this will still result in passwords being re-encrypted with the
 * newer module (as the older module successfully verifies them); another new
 * PBKDF2 computation with a new salt will occur, but this is still no worse
 * than an invocation of NickServ's "SET PASSWORD" command. You will still
 * need to keep the old module in your loadmodule configuration above, as the
 * new module cannot verify digests produced by the old one.
 *
 * If you wish to deploy SASL SCRAM support, please read 'doc/SASL-SCRAM'.
 * Its advice regarding parameter choice takes precedence over this!

	/* (*) argon2_type
	 *
	 * The algorithm type to use for new passwords.
	 *
	 * Argon2d is suitable for use on a dedicated machine that has
	 * limited access. It provides the most resistance to GPU and ASIC
	 * cracking attacks, but its operation is data-dependent; that is,
	 * during its operation, keying material derived from the password
	 * itself is indirectly affecting the execution choices made by the
	 * algorithm. This creates a side-channel that can leak information
	 * about the password to other software running on the same physical
	 * machine.
	 *
	 * Argon2i avoids this by being data-independent. The order of memory
	 * accesses, conditional execution, etc. does not depend on the
	 * password, or any material derived from the password, so no side-
	 * channel that can reveal any information about the password is
	 * created. However, this means that it is easier to bruteforce by a
	 * password cracker, which does not have to account for execution
	 * differences in its implementation. This is the most suitable choice
	 * for running on a virtual machine that is co-located with other,
	 * untrusted, virtual machines, or on a dedicated machine that runs
	 * other, untrusted, software, or has untrusted user access.
	 *
	 * Argon2id is a blend of both, limiting the exploitability of any
	 * side-channels while retaining excellent resistance to GPU and ASIC
	 * cracking. This is suitable for all but the most sensitive of
	 * deployments.
	 *
	 * All algorithm types perform about equally as well as each other;
	 * changing this will not significantly affect the computation time.
	 *

	 * is indicated in your ./configure output ("checking if libargon2
	 * algorithm type Argon2id appears to be usable...").
