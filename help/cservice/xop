Help for xOP:

The xOP commands allow you to maintain channel
access lists. Channel access lists can contain
registered accounts or hostmasks (nick!user@host).

The exact meanings of the access levels may differ
per network, use /msg &nick& TEMPLATE to check. As
#if halfops
a hint, VOP stands for VOice People, HOP stands for
HalfOP, AOP stands for AutoOP, SOP stands for
SuperOP.
#else
a hint, VOP stands for VOice People, AOP stands
for AutoOP, SOP stands for SuperOP.
#endif

Not all channel access entries can be edited
with these commands, see the FLAGS and FORCEXOP
help entries for details. Note that use of
FORCEXOP can destroy a lot of information.
The TEMPLATE system can provide most of the
ease of use of these commands without the
restrictions.

The privileges required to execute these commands are
the same as those required for the corresponding
FLAGS commands.

#if halfops
Syntax: VOP|HOP|AOP|SOP <#channel> ADD|DEL|LIST <nickname|hostmask>
#else
Syntax: VOP|AOP|SOP <#channel> ADD|DEL|LIST <nickname|hostmask>
#endif

Examples:
    /msg &nick& VOP #foo ADD bar
    /msg &nick& VOP #foo ADD foo!*@bar.com
    /msg &nick& AOP #foo DEL bar
    /msg &nick& SOP #foo LIST
