Command - REGISTER
Usage   - REGISTER <account> <password> <email-address>
  
This will register an account with UserServ. This allows
you to get access to channels more easily and use memos
(if enabled). The password is a case-sensitive password
that you make up. Please write down or memorize your
password! You will need it later to change settings.
  
You may be required to confirm the email address. To do this,
follow the instructions in the message sent to the email
address.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& REGISTER foo sesame foo@bar.com
