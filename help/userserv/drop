Help for DROP:

Using this command removes your account from services' database.
You will lose all your channel access and memos. If an account
is dropped, anyone else can re-register it. You need to log in
to services before doing this.  

When dropping and re-registering an account during a netsplit,
users on the other side of the split may later be recognized
as the new account.

Syntax: DROP <account> <password>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& DROP foo bar
