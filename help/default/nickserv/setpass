Help for SETPASS:

SETPASS allows you to set a new password
using a key emailed to you. The key is
valid for one time only, and also becomes
invalid if you identify with your old password.

This command should only be used after you have
already received an email with the key.

To set a new password if you know the current
password, use SET PASSWORD instead of SETPASS.

Syntax: SETPASS <nickname> <key> <password>

Example:
    /msg &nick& SETPASS ilbelkyr llgqriuiosit hunter2
