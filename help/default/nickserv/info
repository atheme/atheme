Help for INFO:

INFO displays account information such as
registration time, flags, and other details.
Additionally it will display registration
and last seen time of the nick you give.

You can query the nick a user is logged in as
by specifying an equals sign followed by their
nick. This '=' convention works with most commands.

Syntax: INFO <nickname>
Syntax: INFO =<online user>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& INFO w00t
Shows information about the registered nick w00t.
    /msg &nick& INFO =w00tie[home]
Shows information about the registered nick the user
w00tie[home] is logged in as.
