Help for REGISTER:

This will register your current nickname with &nick&.
This will allow you to assert some form of identity on
the network and to be added to access lists. Furthermore,
&nick& will warn users using your nick without
identifying and allow you to kill ghosts.
#if module nickserv/group

You can also GROUP other nicknames to this one later on.

The password is a case-sensitive password that you make
up. Please write down or memorize your password! You
will need it later to change settings.

You have to confirm the email address. To do this,
follow the instructions in the message sent to the email

If you do not receive the email, please check the address 
in your INFO. If the address is incorrect, DROP the nick 
and REGISTER it again.
