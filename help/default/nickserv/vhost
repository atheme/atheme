Help for VHOST:

VHOST allows operators to set a virtual host (also
known as a spoof or cloak) on an account. This vHost
will be set on the user immediately and each time
they identify.

Syntax: VHOST <nickname> ON <vHost>
Syntax: VHOST <nickname> OFF

If the nickname is marked, you can override this
using the FORCE keyword.

Syntax: VHOST <nickname> ON <vHost> FORCE
Syntax: VHOST <nickname> OFF FORCE

Examples:
    /msg &nick& VHOST spb ON may.explode.on.impact
    /msg &nick& VHOST nenolod OFF
