Help for AKICK:

The AKICK command allows you to maintain channel
ban lists.  Users on the AKICK list will be
automatically kickbanned when they join the channel,
removing any matching ban exceptions first. Users
with the +r flag are exempt.

Syntax: AKICK <#channel> ADD <nickname|hostmask> [!P|!T <minutes>] [reason]

You may also specify a hostmask (nick!user@host)
for the AKICK list.

The reason is used when kicking and is visible in
AKICK LIST. If the reason contains a '|' character,
everything after it does not appear in kick reasons
but does appear in AKICK LIST.

If the !P token is specified, the AKICK will never
expire (permanent). If the !T token is specified, expire
time must follow, in minutes, hours ("h"), days ("d")
or weeks ("w").

Syntax: AKICK <#channel> DEL <nickname|hostmask>

This will remove an entry from the AKICK list. Removing
an entry will remove any matching channel bans unless the
channel is set NOSYNC.

Syntax: AKICK <#channel> LIST

This will list all entries in the AKICK list, including
the reason and time left until expiration.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& AKICK #foo ADD bar you are annoying | private op info
    /msg &nick& AKICK #foo ADD *!*foo@bar.com !T 5d
    /msg &nick& AKICK #foo DEL bar
    /msg &nick& AKICK #foo LIST
