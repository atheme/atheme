Help for SET TOPICLOCK:

SET TOPICLOCK causes &nick& to revert
topic changes by users without the +t flag.
Topic changes during netsplits or services
outages will always be reverted.

TOPICLOCK requires KEEPTOPIC and will
automatically enable it; disabling KEEPTOPIC
will disable TOPICLOCK also.

Syntax: SET <#channel> TOPICLOCK ON|OFF

Example:
    /msg &nick& SET #foo TOPICLOCK ON
