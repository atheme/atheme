Help for SET FOUNDER:

SET FOUNDER allows you to set a new founder
of the channel. The new founder has to
execute the same command to confirm the
transfer.

Syntax: SET <#channel> FOUNDER <newnick>

If the new founder has not yet confirmed the
transfer, you can cancel it by specifying
your own nick as the new founder.

Syntax: SET <#channel> FOUNDER <yournick>

Example:
    /msg &nick& SET #foo FOUNDER bar
