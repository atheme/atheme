Help for RECOVER:

RECOVER allows you to regain control of your
channel in the event of a takeover.

More precisely, everyone will be deopped,
limit and key will be cleared, all bans
matching you are removed, a ban exception
matching you is added (in case of bans Atheme
can't see), the channel is set invite-only
and moderated and you are invited.

If you are on channel, you will be opped and
no ban exception will be added.

Syntax: RECOVER <#channel>

Example:
    /msg &nick& RECOVER #foo
