Help for FLAGS:

The FLAGS command allows for the granting/removal of channel
privileges on a more specific, non-generalized level. It
supports nicknames, groups and hostmasks as targets.

When only the channel argument is given, a listing of
permissions granted to users will be displayed.

Syntax: FLAGS <#channel>

Otherwise, an access entry is modified. A modification may be
specified by a template name (changes the access to the
template) or a flags change (starts with + or -). See the
TEMPLATE help entry for more information about templates.

#if !halfops
If you are not a founder, you may only manipulate flags you
have yourself, and may not edit users that have flags you
don't have. For this purpose, +v grants the ability to grant
+V, +o grants the ability to grant +O, and +r grants the
ability to grant +b.
#else
If you are not a founder, you may only manipulate flags you
have yourself, and may not edit users that have flags you
don't have. For this purpose, +v grants the ability to grant
+V, +h grants the ability to grant +H, +o grants the ability
to grant +O, and +r grants the ability to grant +b.

#if module chanserv/set_limitflags
If the LIMITFLAGS option is set for the channel, this is
restricted further, see help for SET LIMITFLAGS.

#endif

#if module exttarget/main
As of Atheme 7.0, there are now extended entity targets
which allow you to match chanacs against a situation instead
of against a nickname, hostmask or group.

Available exttargets are:
#endif
#if module exttarget/oper
$oper - Any user who is an oper (user mode +o).
#endif
#if module exttarget/registered
$registered - Any user who is identified to services.
#endif
#if module exttarget/channel
$channel:#channel - Any user who is the member of the given channel.
#endif

If you do not have +f you may still remove your own access
with -*.

Syntax: FLAGS <#channel> [nickname|hostmask|group template]
Syntax: FLAGS <#channel> [nickname|hostmask|group flag_changes]
