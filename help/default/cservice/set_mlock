Help for SET MLOCK:

MLOCK (or "mode lock") allows you to enforce a set
of modes on a channel.  This can prevent abuse in cases
such as +kl. It can also make it harder to fight evil
bots, be careful. Locked modes can be seen by anyone
recreating the channel (this includes keys).

Syntax: SET <#channel> MLOCK [modes]

Examples: (some may use modes your ircd does not support)
    /msg &nick& SET #foo MLOCK +nt-lk
    /msg &nick& SET #foo MLOCK +inst-kl
    /msg &nick& SET #c MLOCK +ntk c
    /msg &nick& SET #foo MLOCK +ntcjf-kl 2:30 #overflow
    /msg &nick& SET #overflow MLOCK +mntF-kljf
    /msg &nick& SET #foo1 MLOCK +ntlL 40 #foo2
