Help for FLAGS:

The FLAGS command allows for the granting/removal of group
privileges on a more specific, non-generalized level. It
supports registered nicknames as targets.

When only the group argument is given, a listing of
permissions granted to users will be displayed.

Syntax: FLAGS <!group>

You can modify a users' flags if you yourself have the +f flag.
This has much the same syntax as chanserv/flags, using + to add
flags to a user and - to remove flags from a user.

Syntax: FLAGS <!group> [nickname flag_changes]

Permissions:
    +f - Enables modification of group access list.
    +F - Grants full founder access.
    +m - Read memos sent to the group.
    +c - Have channel access in channels where the group has sufficient
         privileges.
    +v - Take vhosts offered to the group through HostServ.

The special permission +* adds all permissions except +F.
The special permission -* removes all permissions including +F.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& FLAGS !baz
    /msg &nick& FLAGS !baz foo +F
    /msg &nick& FLAGS !baz foo -*
    /msg &nick& FLAGS !baz foo +fmc
