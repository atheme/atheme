Help for TRACE:

TRACE allows you to match users by any number of criteria and possibly act on it.

Current criteria are:
CHANNEL    - All users in a given channel.
SERVER     - All users on a given server.
REGEXP     - All users matching a given regex pattern. This is very similar to
             RMATCH/RWATCH.
NICKAGE    - How long (in seconds) a user has been connected to the network.
NUMCHAN    - Number of channels a user is in.
IDENTIFIED - Identified status of users matching a specific criteria.

Current actions are:
PRINT - Prints the nick!user@host and some other information about every user
        matching the given criteria.
COUNT - Gives the number of users who match the given criteria.
KILL  - KILLs all users matching the given criteria.
AKILL - AKILLs all users matching the given criteria.

Syntax: TRACE <action> <parameters>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& TRACE print channel #foo
    /msg &nick& TRACE print server irc.dereferenced.org
    /msg &nick& TRACE kill "reason" server alfred.staticbox.net
