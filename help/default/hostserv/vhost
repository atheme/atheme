Help for VHOST:

VHOST allows operators to set a virtual host (also
known as a spoof or cloak) on an account. This vHost
will be set on the user immediately and each time
they identify to their account. If no vHost is
specified, it will clear all existing vHosts on the account.

Syntax: VHOST <nickname> [<vHost>]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& VHOST spb may.explode.on.impact
    /msg &nick& VHOST nenolod
