Help for DELETE:

DELETE allows you to delete memos from your
inbox. You can delete all memos with the
ALL parameter, all read memos with the OLD
parameter, or specify a memo number.

You can obtain a memo number by using the LIST
command. Once you delete a memo, the numbers of
all subsequent memos will change.

You can also SEND, READ, LIST and FORWARD memos.

Syntax: DELETE ALL|OLD|<memo number>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& DELETE OLD
    /msg &nick& DELETE 1
