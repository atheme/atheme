Syntax: AKILL ADD <nick|hostmask> [!P|!T <minutes>] <reason>

If the !P token is specified the AKILL will never expire (permanent).
If the !T token is specified expire time must follow, in minutes,
hours ("h"), days ("d") or weeks ("w").

Examples:
    /msg &nick& AKILL ADD foo !T 5 bar reason
    /msg &nick& AKILL ADD foo !T 3d bar reason
    /msg &nick& AKILL ADD foo@bar.com !P foo reason
    /msg &nick& AKILL ADD foo@bar.com foo reason

The first example looks for the user with a nickname of "foo" and adds
a 5 minute AKILL for "bar reason."

The second example is similar but adds the AKILL for 3 days instead of
5 minutes.

The third example adds a permanent AKILL on foo@bar.com for "foo reason."

The fourth example adds a AKILL on foo@bar.com for the duration specified
in the configuration file for "foo reason."
