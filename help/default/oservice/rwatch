Help for RWATCH:

RWATCH maintains a list of regular expressions,
which the nick!user@host gecos
of all connecting clients are matched against.
Matching clients can be displayed in the snoop
channel and/or banned from the network. These
network bans are set on *@host, last 24 hours
and are not added to the AKILL list.
The RWATCH list is stored in etc/rwatch.db and
saved whenever it is modified.

See RMATCH for more information about regular
expression syntax.

Syntax: RWATCH ADD /<pattern>/[i][p] <reason>

Adds a regular expression to the RWATCH list.
The reason is shown in snoop notices and kline reasons.

Syntax: RWATCH DEL /<pattern>/[i][p]

Removes a regular expression from the RWATCH list.

Syntax: RWATCH LIST

Shows the RWATCH list. The meaning of the letters is:
    i - case insensitive match
    p - PCRE pattern
    S - matching clients are shown in the snoop channel
    K - matching clients are banned from the network

Syntax: RWATCH SET /<pattern>/[i][p] <options>

Changes the action for a regular expression. Possible
values for <options> are:
    SNOOP   - enables display in the snoop channel
    NOSNOOP - disables display in the snoop channel
    KLINE   - enables network bans
    NOKLINE - disables network bans

Example:
    /msg &nick& RWATCH ADD /^m(oo|00)cow/i moocow figure
    /msg &nick& RWATCH DEL /^m(oo|00)cow/i
