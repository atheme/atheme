Help for CLONES:

CLONES keeps track of the number of clients
per IP address. Warnings are displayed in
the snoop channel about IP addresses with
multiple clients.

CLONES only works on clients whose IP address
Atheme knows. If the ircd does not support
propagating IP addresses at all, CLONES is
not useful; if IP addresses are not sent for
spoofed clients, those clients are exempt from
CLONES checking.

Syntax: CLONES KLINE ON|OFF

Enables/disables banning IP addresses with more
than the allowed number clients from the network
for one hour (these bans are not added to the 
AKILL list). This setting is saved in etc/services.db
and defaults to off.

Syntax: CLONES LIST

Shows all IP addresses with more than 3 clients
with the number of clients and whether the IP
address is exempt.

Syntax: CLONES ADDEXEMPT <ip> <clones> [!P|!T <minutes>] <reason>

Adds an IP address to the clone exemption list.
The IP address must match exactly with the form
used by the ircd (mind '::' shortening with IPv6).
The IP address can also be a CIDR mask, for example
192.168.1.0/24. Single IPs take priority above CIDR.
<clones> is the number of clones allowed; it must be
at least 4. Warnings are sent if this number is
met, and a network ban may be set if the number
is exceeded.
The reason is shown in LISTEXEMPT.
The clone exemption list is stored in etc/services.db.

Syntax: CLONES DELEXEMPT <ip>

Removes an IP address from the clone exemption list.

Syntax: CLONES SETEXEMPT [DEFAULT | <ip>] <ALLOWED | WARN | KILL> <limit>

Sets either the default or a given exemption's ALLOWED, 
WARN, or KILL limit to the specified number of clones. 
WARN or KILL can be 0, disabling any warning messages or kills.

Syntax: CLONES SETEXEMPT <ip> <REASON | DURATION> <value>

Sets the reason or duration of a given exemption to the
specified value. The DURATION value can be 0, making the 
exemption permanent.

Syntax: CLONES LISTEXEMPT

Shows the clone exemption list with reasons.

Example:
    /msg &nick& CLONES ADDEXEMPT 127.0.0.1 100 local
    /msg &nick& CLONES DELEXEMPT 192.168.1.2

Syntax: CLONES DURATION

Allows modifying the duration that hosts who clone
are banned for. Defaults to one hour. Is saved between
restarts.

Example:
    /msg &nick& CLONES DURATION 30m
