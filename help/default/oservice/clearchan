Help for CLEARCHAN:

CLEARCHAN allows operators to clear
a channel in one of three ways: KICK,
which kicks all users from the channel, KILL,
which kills all users in the channel off the
network, or AKILL, which sets a network ban
against the hosts of all users in the channel,
using the configured default network ban
duration.

This command should not be used lightly.

Syntax: CLEARCHAN KICK|KILL|AKILL <#channel> <reason>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& CLEARCHAN KICK #warez warez is bad, mk?
    /msg &nick& CLEARCHAN AKILL #warez you were warned!
