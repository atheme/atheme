Help for RAKILL:

RAKILL allows for regex-based akills,
which are useful for removing clones
or botnets. The akills are not added
to &nick&'s list and use the
configured default network ban
duration.

Be careful, as regex is very easy to
make mistakes with. Use RMATCH first.
The regex syntax is exactly the same.

Syntax: RAKILL /<pattern>/[i][p] <reason>

Example:
    /msg &nick& RAKILL /^m(oo|00)cow/i No moocows allowed.
