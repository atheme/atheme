Help for CLONES:

CLONES keeps track of the number of clients
per IP address. Warnings are displayed in
the snoop channel about IP addresses with
more than 3 clients, and network bans may
optionally be set on IP addresses with more
than 5 clients.

CLONES only works on clients whose IP address
Atheme knows. If the ircd does not support
propagating IP addresses at all, CLONES is
not useful; if IP addresses are not sent for
spoofed clients, those clients are exempt from
CLONES checking.

Syntax: CLONES KLINE ON|OFF

Enables/disables banning IP addresses with more
than 5 clients from the network for one hour
(these bans are not added to the AKILL list).
This setting is saved in etc/exempts.db and
defaults to off.

Syntax: CLONES LIST

Shows all IP addresses with more than 3 clients
with the number of clients and whether the IP
address is exempt.

Syntax: CLONES ADDEXEMPT <ip> <clones> <reason>

Adds an IP address to the clone exemption list.
The IP address must match exactly with the form
used by the ircd (mind '::' shortening with IPv6).
<clones> is the number of clones allowed; it must be
at least 4. Warnings are sent if this number is
exceeded, and a network ban may be set if the number
is exceeded by 10 or more.
The reason is shown in LISTEXEMPT.
The clone exemption list is stored in etc/exempts.db
and saved whenever it is modified.

Syntax: CLONES DELEXEMPT <ip>

Removes an IP address from the clone exemption list.

Syntax: CLONES LISTEXEMPT

Shows the clone exemption list with reasons.

Example:
    /msg &nick& CLONES ADDEXEMPT 127.0.0.1 100 local
    /msg &nick& CLONES DELEXEMPT 192.168.1.2
