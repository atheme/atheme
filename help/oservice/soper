SOPER allows manipulation of services operator privileges.

SOPER LIST shows all accounts with services operator
privileges, both from the configuration file and
this command. It is similar to /stats o &nick&.

SOPER LISTCLASS shows all defined oper classes. Use
the SPECS command to view the privileges associated
with an oper class.

oper class.

an account.
