Help for IGNORE:

Services has an ignore list which functions similarly to the way a user can ignore another user. If a user matches a mask in the ignore list and attempts to use services, he or she will not get a reply. Ignores do not affect IRC operators.

ADD - Add a mask to the ignore list.
DEL - Delete a mask from the ignore list.
LIST - List all the entries in the ignore list.
CLEAR - Clear all the entries in the ignore list.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& ignore add pfish!*@* flooding services
    /msg &nick& ignore del pfish!*@*
    /msg &nick& ignore list
    /msg &nick& ignore clear
