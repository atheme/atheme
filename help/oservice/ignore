Help for IGNORE:

Services has an ignore list which functions similarly to
the way a user can ignore another user. If a user matches
a mask in the ignore list and attempts to use services,
they will not get a reply.

    ADD   - Add a mask to the ignore list.
    DEL   - Delete a mask from the ignore list.
    LIST  - List all the entries in the ignore list.
    CLEAR - Clear all the entries in the ignore list.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& IGNORE ADD pfish!*@* flooding services
    /msg &nick& IGNORE DEL pfish!*@*
    /msg &nick& IGNORE LIST
    /msg &nick& IGNORE CLEAR
