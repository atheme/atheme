Help for RAKILL:

RAKILL allows for regex-based akills,
which are useful for removing clones
or botnets. The akills are not added
to &nick&'s list and last a week.

Be careful, as regex is very easy to
make mistakes with. Use RMATCH first.
The regex syntax is exactly the same.

Syntax: RAKILL /<pattern>/[i][p] <reason>

Example:
    /msg &nick& RAKILL /^m[oo|00]cow/i No moocows allowed.
