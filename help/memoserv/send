Help for SEND:

SEND allows you to send a memo to a nickname
that is offline at the moment.  When they
come online they will be told they have messages
waiting for them and will have an opportunity
to read your memo.

Your memo cannot be more than 300 characters.

Syntax: SEND <user|nick> text

Examples:
    /msg &nick& SEND Kog pay your bills
