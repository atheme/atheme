Help for DROP:

DROP allows you to "unregister" a registered group.

Once you DROP a group all of the data associated
with it (access lists, metadata, etc) are removed and cannot
be restored.

See help on FLAGS for transferring a group to another user.

Syntax: DROP <!group>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& DROP !baz
