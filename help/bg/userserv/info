Help for INFO:

INFO displays account information such as
registration time, flags, and other details.

You can query the account a user is logged in as
by specifying an equals sign followed by their
nick. This '=' convention works with most commands.

Syntax: INFO <account>
Syntax: INFO =<online user>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& INFO w00t
Shows information about the account w00t.
    /msg &nick& INFO =w00tie[home]
Shows information about the account the user
w00tie[home] is logged in as.
