Help for POST:

POST allows you to post one-time messages to all users (that will be sent when
you run the command) or messages that all users will see upon connect or
messages only opers will see when they oper-up.

Underscores ("_") in the subject will be replaced by spaces.

IMPORTANCE:
    Importance defines the type of message that will be sent.

    0 - Only display to opers upon oper-up.
    1 - Only display to users upon connect.
    2 - Send a notice to all users now.
    3 - Display message to all users upon connect AND send a notice to
            all users now.
    4 - Send a privmsg/query to all users now. It is important to note that this
            may annoy users and should only be used when absolutely necessary.


Syntax: POST <importance> <subject> <message>

Example:
    /msg &nick& POST 2 Info1 Some important information for users.
    /msg &nick& POST 1 Multi_Word_Subject Some more information.
