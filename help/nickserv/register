Command - REGISTER
Usage   - REGISTER <password> <email-address>
  
This will register your current nickname with NickServ. This
means that only you can have access to this nickname, unless
you give access to others. The password is a case-sensitive
password that you make up. Please write down or memorize
your password! You will need it later to change settings.

You may be required to confirm the email address. To do this,
follow the instructions in the message sent to the email
address.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& REGISTER bar foo@bar.com
