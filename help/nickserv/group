Help for GROUP:

GROUP registers your current nickname to your account.
This means that &nick& protects this nickname the
same way as it protects your account name. Most
services commands will accept the new nickname as
an alias for your account name.

Please note that grouped nicks expire separately
from accounts. To prevent this, you must use them.
Otherwise, all properties of the account are shared
among all nicks registered to it.

Syntax: GROUP

Examples:
    /msg &nick& IDENTIFY OldNick SecretPassword
    /msg &nick& GROUP
