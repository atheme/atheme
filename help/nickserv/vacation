Help for VACATION:

VACATION extends the expiration time for your
account and nicknames (but not your channels)
to three times the usual value. You can only
do this if your account is registered long
enough.

Vacation mode is disabled automatically the
next time you identify to &nick&.

Syntax: VACATION

Examples:
    /msg &nick& VACATION
