Help for SET ENFORCE:

SET ENFORCE allows you to enable more protection for
all nicknames registered to your account.

This will automatically change the nick of someone
who attempts to use it without identifying in time,
and temporarily block its use, which can be
removed at your discretion. See help on RELEASE.

Syntax: SET ENFORCE ON|OFF
