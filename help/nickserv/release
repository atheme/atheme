Help for RELEASE:

RELEASE removes an enforcer for your nick or
changes the nick of a user that is using your
nick.

Enforcers are created when someone uses your
nick without identifying and prevent all use
of it.

If you are logged in to the nick, you need not specify
a password, otherwise you have to.

Syntax: RELEASE <nick> [password]

Example:
    /msg &nick& RELEASE smith sesame
