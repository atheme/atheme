Help for ACCESS:

ACCESS maintains a list of user@host masks from where
&nick& will recognize you, so it will not prompt you to
change nick or identify. Getting channel access or
editing nickname settings still requires identification,
however. Also, you can only be recognized as the nick you
are currently using.

Access list entries can use hostnames with optional
wildcards, IP addresses and CIDR masks. There are
restrictions on how much you can wildcard.

Syntax: ACCESS LIST
Syntax: ACCESS ADD <mask>
Syntax: ACCESS DEL <mask>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& ACCESS LIST
    /msg &nick& ACCESS ADD jack@host.example.com
    /msg &nick& ACCESS ADD user@10.0.0.8
    /msg &nick& ACCESS ADD jilles@192.168.1.0/24
    /msg &nick& ACCESS DEL *someone@*.area.old.example.net
