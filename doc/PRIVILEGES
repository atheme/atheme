Fine grained operator privileges
--------------------------------

Terminology:

IRCop
	user with user mode +o, usually obtained with /oper
	users whose operator status is indicated by a different user mode
	than +o, or whose user mode +o is not propagated to other servers,
	are not IRCops from atheme's point of view
operclass
	group of privileges defined in an operclass{} block in atheme.conf
config services operator
	user logged into an account named in an operator{} block in
	atheme.conf
services operator
	user logged into an account named in an operator{} block in
	atheme.conf or an account granted privileges with /os soper

Note that an account cannot have both an operator{} block and privileges
granted with /os soper. If this happens, the privileges from /os soper
will be discarded.

A few privileges are granted independently of operclasses:

To all IRCops and services operators (has_any_priv()):
	more detailed "not authorized" messages telling which priv they are
	missing, ability to use /os help

To all config services operators:
	account does not expire (unlike HOLD, extra grouped nicknames do);
	this is to avoid someone else registering the account and taking
	the privs

To all services operators:
	operations like drop, sendpass and return are restricted

All IRCops get the privileges in the "ircop" operclass. Services operators
get the privileges in the operclass in their operator{} block or the
operclass set with /os soper. However, if the operclass has the needoper
flag set, privileges are only granted to IRC users if they are IRCops, and
if the services operator has a password set, privileges are only granted to
IRC users if they have entered that password using the OperServ IDENTIFY
command. If both conditions apply, the union of the privileges is granted.

The OperServ SPECS command shows the privileges granted to an online user
or operclass, in a somewhat wordy format. /stats o and SOPER LIST show all
services operators. SOPER LISTCLASS shows all operclasses.

Description of the privileges in operclasses:

special:ircop
	bound to AC_IRCOP, if you still have modules using that
special:disabled
	for internal use, used to hide commands without meaning
	do not add this to operclasses

user:auspex
	see the invisible about user registrations,
	ns/us info/list mainly
	also allows searching information about online users,
	os rnc/rmatch/rwatch
user:admin
	administer users
user:sendpass
	send user passwords to their email addresses, or in case of
	nickserv/sendpass_user, use the CLEAR option
user:vhost
	set vhosts
user:fregister
	use /ns fregister (contrib module) to register accounts on behalf of
	someone else

chan:auspex
	see the invisible about channels and channel registrations,
	cs info/list/flags, ns/us listchans, os compare mainly
chan:admin
	administer channels
chan:cmodes
	change oper-only cmodes in mode locks (but only on own channels)
chan:joinstaffonly
	join channels set restricted, even if not on the access list

user:mark
	use ns/us/cs mark and override marks
user:hold
	use ns/us/cs hold to prevent things from expiring
user:regnolimit
	exempt from limits on numbers of registrations (does not work
	fully if set on the ircop operclass)

general:auspex
	see general information about services: most privileged /stats,
	/trace, /os modinspect, /os modlist, /os uptime
	the idea is that this does not violate user privacy
general:viewprivs
	see all operator{} blocks, see the privs users and operclasses have:
	/stats o, /os specs
general:flood
	exempt from services flood control (general::flood* in atheme.conf)
general:metadata
	mess with private metadata (but only on own accounts and channels)
general:admin
	restart/shutdown/rehash services, load modules, use raw/inject (if
	globally allowed in atheme.conf), resetpass/sendpass on accounts
	with operator{} blocks, use /os ignore

operserv:omode
	use /os mode
operserv:akill
	use /os akill and /stats k
operserv:massakill
	do mass kills and akills on channels and regular expressions (/os
	clearchan/rakill/rwatch), use /os sgline and /stats x
	this may also need chan:admin or user:auspex depending on the command
operserv:akill-anymask
	set akills which do not have any non-wildcard requirements
operserv:jupe
	use /os jupe
operserv:noop
	use /os noop
operserv:global
	send global notices
operserv:grant
	use /os soper add/del
operserv:override
	use /os override to run services commands as other users

group:auspex
	see the invisible about groups and group registrations,
	groupserv info/list/flags, ns/us listgroups mainly
group:admin
	administer groups
