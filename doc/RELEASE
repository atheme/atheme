Atheme 2.1 Release Notes
========================
ircd protocol
- The inspircd11 protocol module now sends wallops as server notices
  and no longer needs m_globops.so (but still uses it if loaded).
- When sending a notice to a channel as a server notice (because the
  service is not on channel and the ircd would not allow the notice),
  prepend it with "[<service>:<channel>] " instead of "<service>: "
nickserv
- Add nickname grouping, this allows users to register multiple nicks
  to one account. The GROUP and UNGROUP commands add and remove additional
  nicks. Additional nicks expire separately from the main account.
- The ACCESS ADD command now converts masks like 1.2.3.* to CIDR masks
  instead of rejecting them.
- Add LISTVHOST command.
chanserv
- The TEMPLATE command now allows updating all channel access entries
  matching the template with a template change, by prefixing a flag
  change with an '!'.
- Add SYNC command to contrib, makes channel status agree with flags.
- Add FFLAGS command, allows opers to force a flags change on any channel.
- On newly registered channels, only mlock -l if no limit is set
  and only mlock -k if no key is set.
- Show channel email address in INFO.
- Add chanserv::trigger option, allows changing the '!' in fantasy commands
  to something else. The special case for '.flags' has been removed.
- Add SET GUARD, allows toggling whether ChanServ joins the channel on a
  per-channel basis. The general::join_chans option determines whether
  SET GUARD can be used.
- Make the WHY command show all flags.
oper
- Add /os soper, allows adding services operators at run time.
- Add operclass::needoper option, denies giving any privilege to IRC users
  matching this operclass who are not IRCops.
- Add some more log levels and generally clean up logging, for example
  allow disabling logging of all commands.
code
- Remove irccmp() and ircncmp(). These functions were equivalent to strcmp()
  and strncmp(). IRC-style case-insensitive comparisons are irccasecmp() and
  ircncasecmp().
- Make clog unavailable outside libatheme/ and rename it. Other code should
  use slog(), logcommand(), etc. to log things.
documentation
- Add some missing help files.
other
- chanserv::changets is now shown as 't' in version replies
- Make --enable-fhs-paths also affect the location of the log file, data
  files and pid file. Note that for data files to work with
  --enable-fhs-paths, they need to use DATADIR instead of "etc".

Atheme 2.0 Release Notes
========================
ircd protocol
- The ptlink module now assumes +a (channel admin) and +h (halfops) exist.
- Make protocol parsing stricter, rejecting various illegal messages.
- Don't leave empty channels if all users in a channel are killed or invalid.
- Add support for EUID (real host behind dynamic spoofs and login name in same
  message as user introduction) to the charybdis module.
- Split inspircd support in inspircd10 for 1.0 and inspircd11 for 1.1.
- Add chanserv::changets support to the inspircd11 module.
- Add STATS, ADMIN and MOTD support to the inspircd11 module.
- Add SVSHOLD support (nickname enforcers that are not clients) to the
  protocol abstraction.
services
- Make CTCP replies generic to all services.
- Make services commands more generic, allowing them to be called in other
  ways than from IRC.
- Show more details when describing users issuing commands, for example
  the account name if it is different from the nick.
- Send no such nick reply if we get a message to a nonexistent service.
- Support CIDR channel bans/exceptions and akills.
- Shut down if too many services are killed in one second.
- Handle SASL logins more cleanly.
nickserv
- Move nickname enforcement module from contrib to modules. This forces
  nickname changes on users who do not identify to their nick.
- Add gen_vhostonreg module to contrib from atheme-modules, sets a vhost on
  new nick/account registrations.
- Make it possible for nickserv to act as userserv with the
  nickserv::no_nick_ownership config option and the nickserv/login module.
  Remove the old userserv which mostly consisted of a duplicate of nickserv.
- Add nickname access lists; users matching an u@h mask on the access list for
  a nick will not be warned to identify and will not be affected by nickname
  enforcement, and the last login time will be updated. Channel access will
  not be granted.
- Make /ns acc a bit more usable.
chanserv
- Add TOPICLOCK flag, reverts topic changes by users who do not have +t flag.
- Store the channelTS of registered channels in the private:channelts metadata
  entry. This is used to make chanserv::changets nicer and to avoid KEEPTOPIC
  restores if the channel was not recreated.
- Also give VERBOSE notices on foundership changes.
- Fantasy and regular commands now use the same code. Fantasy commands are
  executed with VERBOSE set. This allows executing all chanserv commands
  affecting a single registered channel, except DROP and SET, as a fantasy
  command but removes some aliases.
- Allow /cs status when not logged in.
- Add /cs count from contrib, shows how many entries are in access lists.
oper
- Add a privilege operserv:massakill to control new commands that may
  do mass kills.
- Add /os clearchan, kicks, kills or klines all non-IRCops in a channel.
- Add /os compare, shows common channels of two users or common users in two
  channels.
- Add /os rmatch, shows all users matching a regular expression.
- Add /os rakill, bans all users matching a regular expression from the
  network.
- Add /os rnc, shows the most common realnames on the network.
- Add /os clones, watches the network for IPs with too many connections.
- Add operserv rwatch, a list of regular expressions all connecting clients
  are matched against. Matching clients are described in the snoop channel
  and/or klined.
- Add /stats B, shows hash statistics, requires general:auspex privilege.
- Add messages to the snoop channels about various things that used to
  generate wallops only; move some other things from wallops to snoops.
- Add /stats f, shows some information about open connections.
xmlrpc
- Clean up the HTTP protocol handling considerably.
- Allow pipelining multiple calls over one connection.
- Allow calling most services commands via XMLRPC.
- Allow passing a parameter (typically true source IP address) to various
  XMLRPC methods, which will be logged.
documentation
- Add a script to convert the help files to HTML.
- Make various help files clearer.
code
- Replace the old hashtables with a cleaner and more powerful dictionary tree
  implementation.
- Make 'make depend' work, this allows only recompiling what is necessary.
- Move around many things to different source files, hopefully making it
  easier to find things.
- Restrict visibility of some uplink-related declarations (uplink.h and
  pmodule.h no longer included by atheme.h).
- Add ability to run/build Atheme without the block allocator (for debugging).
- Change parameter type for the channel_join and channel_part hooks to
  hook_channel_joinpart_t *. This avoids ugliness when the first hook kicks
  out the user and the next uses freed memory.
- Rewrite much of the network I/O code.
- Pass less nicks and UIDs around in string form.
- Remove the win32 port, it was hopelessly broken and nobody cares about it.
- Add more comments about what various functions do.
other
- Get rid of signal-related race conditions.
- Add DESTDIR support to the build system (allows installing to a different
  path than where we expect to run from).
- Add sorservices-compatible password encryption support.
- Various bugfixes and cleanups.

  with the new chanserv::changets config option (for charybdis, ratbox,
  hybrid, bahamut, solidircd).

Atheme 1.1 Release Notes
========================
- Shorten /msg chanserv/nickserv/userserv help, the full command list
  is on /msg *serv help commands.

- Disallow vhosts which are too long or contain @!*?
- Don't introduce a service with a UID if the ircd does not support UIDs
  when loading it at runtime.
- Change regex_match API to be more efficient.
- Disable modrestart, it cannot possibly work. (It used to crash.)
- Add wumpus, a service providing a game, to contrib.
- Add source of the message to hook_cmessage_data_t.
- Add optional new syntax for operclass{} blocks.

  the real host behind a services vhost is not shown to nonopers.
- Add support for /motd <atheme>, uses PREFIX/etc/atheme.motd.
- Allow users to GHOST other nicks which are logged into their account.
- Allow other services than chanserv to process fantasy commands.

- Add IP glob akill matching, for ircds that send user IP addresses.
- Move akill checking to operserv/akill module.
- Don't allocate me.name/me.numeric on rehash. This fixes a known P10
  issue.
- Add support for ircu2.10.12's +D mode, which was already implemented
  in Asuka.

Atheme 1.0 Release Notes
========================
- Add ability to use =<nick> where accounts are used. (it aliases to the
  User's account).
- Deop users recreating registered channels if they do not have op flags.
  This attempts not to affect channels created longer ago.
- Add separate protocol module for ircd-hybrid, with CHGHOST support.
- Add ircd name to /version output.
- Add atheme.account.vhost XMLRPC for setting and removing vhosts. Note
  that this, unlike the other XMLRPCs, allows things that the given
  credentials would not normally (over IRC) be allowed to.
- Remove the incomplete and cluttering nickname linking system (this was
  actually done in 1.0rc1, but we forgot to mention it).
- Don't allocate me.name/me.numeric on rehash. This fixes a known P10
  issue.
- Add support for ircu2.10.12's +D mode, which was already implemented
  in Asuka.
- Always send both the channel TS and the topic TS when setting a topic
  under P10 ircd's.

Atheme 1.0rc1 Release Notes
===========================
- Add capabilities to protocol modules:
  - forced nick change (aka SVSNICK)
  - invite
  - channel op notice (aka WALLCHOPS)
- Don't unkline temp akills if they have already expired.
- AKILL wildcard checking changed to ratbox algorithm.
- Further simplification of access checking.
- Hostmask access entries now check vhost, not host. This means services
  cloaks now work in access lists.
- InspIRCd module updated to beta6 and above (tree linking instead of mesh).
- For akicks, use a matching +b'ed hostmask if possible.
- For ircds with dalnet-like +r umodes, don't set it for userserv.
- Add /cs forcexop to reset access levels to xOP values. Useful if CA_?OP
  are changed.
- Make CA_?OP configurable in atheme.conf.
- Add channel_info hook on /cs info.
- Add per-channel flags templates. Templates can be specified in the flags
  command, avoiding the need to memorize complicated flags strings.
  Templates are manipulated with the TEMPLATE command which is similar to the
  FLAGS command.  The xOP levels can also be used as templates.
- Add per-channel fantasy command disable.
- Fix NEVEROP and NOOP options.
- If fantasy commands are globally disabled, mark services clients as "deaf"
  for some ircds.
- Add /cs set verbose ops, works like /cs set verbose on but only shows to
  channel ops.
- Allow users to remove their own access from channels (except akicks of
  course).
- Some improvements to network I/O.
- Add support for permanent (+P) channels in charybdis/hyperion/shadowircd.
- Add support for more FHS-like paths (not really complete but should still
  be helpful for packagers).
- Add fine grained services operator privileges. IRCops get certain
  privileges, and registered accounts can be granted privileges. This
  works via atheme.conf. You will need to redo the operator part of your
  configuration. See the new example.conf and doc/PRIVILEGES for more
  information.
- Add message translation support.
- /cs voice/halfop/op now notifies the target user who did it.
- /cs flags mentions who gave the command in the verbose notice.
- Remove many redundant confirming notices.
- Regardless of join_chans/leave_chans, join chanserv temporarily to
  channels which would otherwise be empty to enforce akick or staffonly.
- Add nickserv enforcement (FNC users who do not identify in time) to
  contrib.
- Drastically improve P10 support.
- Add solidircd support.
- Add support for ban exceptions and other ban-like modes.
- Remove possibilities to log in to accounts without password by changing
  nick during a netsplit on an ircd that does not clear +r (or similar) on
  nick changes.
- Various minor tweaks and bugfixes.

Atheme 0.3 Release Notes
========================
- All services have been entirely modularized. You will need to
  redo your configuration. An authentication service has been
  added (choose from either NickServ or UserServ,) for
  UserServ you should use example.userserv.conf.
- The way modules work has been changed almost entirely. Please try
  loading bad modules especially on macintosh and AIX systems, thanks!
  (Report any negative findings to the tracker.)
- The way sockets work has also changed entirely. We'd love to know
  how well the new poll and kqueue code is working, and if there
  are any issues with it.
- Support for poll() and kqueue() have been added, please comment on
  performance differentials.
- Most static object structures are now described as metadata, please
  comment on how well this transition is working for you.
- PostgreSQL support is starting to freeze. Please note schema changes
  in SQL/atheme_init.sql.
- The build system has been reworked. You may need to use gmake on
  BSD systems. Please comment on any trouble you have had with building
  Atheme (on the tracker, of course.)
- protocol/hyperion supports login session tracking now, please comment
  on how well it is working for you.
- protocol/ratbox support for login sessions has also vastly improved.
- dbtool is most likely broken right now. This is not likely to change
  any time soon.
- The configuration parser has been overhauled. Please report any crashes
  when parsing configurations.
- Channel passwords have been removed.
- Most access checking has been simplified, please make sure it is working
  properly on your network.
- w00t has gone and entirely tokenized the Unreal protocol support. Please
  report any issues with this that you find.
- STATS is now abstracted instead of living in 15 different protocol modules.
- Probably much more that we have missed :)

Atheme 0.2 Release Notes
========================
- Way too many things to note.

Atheme 0.2rc1 Release Notes
========================
- Protocol support has been modularized.
- The configuration format has drastically changed. Please redo your config.
- The core has been modularized. Please provide feedback if something is not
  working as it should.
- Module support has been added. To compile third party modules, add them to
  the modules directory and rerun setup/configure. Any modules in your
  installation's modules/ directory will be automatically loaded at startup.
- Metadata support has been added. To experiment with it, see our wiki
  information on the topic:

  http://wiki.oscnet.org/index.php/Atheme:Experimenting_with_Metadata
- Several NickServ-related bugs have been fixed.
- IRCNet support is marked as experimental. If you run this ircd,
  please give us feedback on how well it functions.

Atheme 0.1 Release Notes
========================

- Dancer/Hyperion IRCd support is marked as experimental. If you run this ircd,
  please give us feedback on how well it functions.
- Chunky Monkey IRCd is also marked as experimental. If you run this ircd,
  please give us feedback on how well it functions.
- NickServ support is experimental. We would like suggestions on how to improve it.
  If you would like to use it, you should use the example-traditional.conf file,
  instead of the example.conf. This will set up a logical environment for NickServ to
  operate in.
- InspIRCd support passes our regression tests, however, we would like feedback
  concerning how well it works. Features added by optional modules are not supported
  at this time. You will need the m_services.so module loaded to make things work
  100% properly.
- UnrealIRCd support is implemented fairly well, but not all features are supported.
- Bahamut 1.8 support has not been tested against 1.8.4, though it is expected that
  1.8.4 should work fine.
- TSora IRCd support (ratbox) does not support TS6, and probably never will.

If you need help, drop by AthemeNet and ask:
  irc.atheme.org #atheme

Thanks!
