Atheme 2.2 uses GNU Gettext for translation of strings that are
user-visible. This allows for networks to change the language that
Atheme uses for its interface.

Support for multiple concurrent languages is planned, but this is
not yet realized entirely. This won't be accomplished in 2.2.

We would like your help with translating Atheme into your native
language. In order to do this, I suggest installing a po-file
editor such as poEdit. poEdit is a lot nicer for translation work
than a traditional text editor, although that will do as well, as
long as the file is in UTF-8.

To start the translation, you should open atheme.pot in a text
editor or poEdit. In poEdit, you can start a new project using the
pot, which is more useful than just editing it, but that is not
covered here.

Once you have completed the translation, you should file a bug on
the atheme bugtracker, and attach the file.

Atheme will run in the locale that you have chosen in your
environment (LANG, LC_* environment variables).
