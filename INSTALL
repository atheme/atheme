1. INSTALLATION
---------------

NOTE: if you are using a third party package of Services, most of this section
will not apply.

IMPORTANT NOTE: it is not recommended to use and install services as root.
Use an unprivileged user account.

Services should compile and run on most POSIX compliant systems. The current
version is known to work on:
	FreeBSD 6.3              (i386, amd64)
	FreeBSD 7.0              (i386, amd64)
	FreeBSD 8.0              (i386, amd64)
	Linux (glibc) 2.6.x, 2.7.x, 2.8.x, 2.10.x, 2.11.x   (i386, amd64)
	MacOS 10.5               (intel) (*)

Older versions have been tested on:
	FreeBSD 5.[0,1,2,3,4,5]
	FreeBSD 6.[0,1,2]
	OpenBSD 3.[5,6,7,8]      (i386, amd64, sparc)
	NetBSD 1.[5,6]           (i386, amd64, sparc)
	NetBSD 2.[0]             (i386, amd64, sparc, mips)
	NetBSD 3.[0]             (i386)
	DragonFly 1.[0,2,5]
	Solaris [7,8,9,10]       (i86pc, sun4u)
	Solaris Express 10       (i86pc, sun4u)
	MacOS 10.[3.5,4.1]       (intel, powerpc)

For MacOS 10, install libmowgli (version 0.7.x) and pkg-config separately,
possibly using a package/ports system. The included libmowgli does not
work on MacOS 10.

Other BSD-based systems will probably work. Other SysV-based systems *might*
work provided they support BSD sockets and POSIX function calls.

Services requires a runtime linker. Systems which do not have a runtime linker
will not be able to run services. However, most systems include a runtime
linker these days.

IRCd's known to be supported by Services are listed in the example 
config (dist/atheme.conf.example). The recommended ones are charybdis, ratbox, 
inspircd, asuka, beware ircd (bircd), shadowircd, nefarious and undernet-ircu 
(undernet).

Run the "configure" script:
	$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/

If no prefix is specified, the default install path is ~/atheme/.

If you're running a large network (more than 2000 users), you should 
pass the --enable-large-net switch to configure for enhanced performance.

The "configure" script will run several tests, write several files, and exit.
Once this is done you will want to compile services. To do this, simply 
type:
	$ make

If you are on a BSD-based operating system, you may get an error like:

"Makefile", line 1: Need an operator
"Makefile", line 2: Need an operator
make: fatal errors encountered -- cannot continue

upon running 'make'. If so, run gmake instead.

Services will compile. To install, type:
	$ make install

If you get an error like this:

/usr/bin/install: cannot stat `es.mo': No such file or directory
Failed to install es.mo!

All you have to do is rerun the "configure" script and pass --disable-nls to it
like so:    $ ./configure --disable-nls
It can also be fixed by installing your operating system's gettext package.


The newly-compiled binary and several supporting files will be copied to the
directory you specified in the "configure" script. If no directory (prefix)
was specified, all the relevant files will be in ~/atheme/.

It is recommended to keep the source directory; you will need it to
(re)compile modules later.

Next, you'll want to go to the directory you specified in "configure" and edit
etc/atheme.conf. You'll need to change every setting or services will 
not work.

2. UPGRADING
------------

IMPORTANT NOTE: backup your configuration file and database!

All custom modules should be recompiled as well. Loading old modules can
cause services to crash.

Sometimes upgrading requires more than recompiling and reinstalling. Be sure to
read NEWS for important notes concerning the release. This file will
let you know if you need to change your configuration or convert your database
to a new format.

3. SETTING UP IRCD
------------------

Services acts as an IRC server with pseudo-clients on it. To link it to 
your network, you'll need to add some lines in your IRCd's 
configuration. Services connects to your IRCd, not the other way around.

It is suggested that you set up your IRCd (IRC operator access, etc) before
trying to connect services. Many IRCds do not log much about server 
connections, so it is best to connect as an IRC operator and watch the 
server notices.

As for the actual lines that need to be added, every IRCd is different. Look
for documentation for "connect{}" or "link{}" or "C/N lines" for your IRCd. You
need to allow services to introduce other servers (e.g. "hub_mask" or "H 
line"), otherwise it will probably be disconnected when the OperServ 
JUPE command is used.

To be perfectly honest, if you can't figure this out you should be running
neither IRCd nor services.

Additionally, you need to do some configuration on all servers on the network.
You need to reserve ("resv{}", "/resv", "Q line", etc) all nicks 
services uses to avoid normal users taking those nicks and causing 
trouble. Also, many IRCds need to be configured to grant special 
privileges to services ("service{}", "shared{}", "ulines{}", "U lines", 
etc).

See doc/IRCD for more details concerning IRCd-specific requirements for 
running services.

4. STARTING SERVICES
--------------------

Go into the directory where you installed atheme-services (by default, 
~/atheme/). Type ./bin/atheme-services to launch services.

Services will report any errors and/or detach into the background.

If services doesn't link and/or terminates without warning check the log
file (var/atheme.log) to see what happened. If this tells you nothing try
rerunning services via ./bin/atheme-services -dn for more verbose 
information.

5. SETTING UP A CRONTAB ENTRY
-----------------------------

A crontab entry will allow you to check periodically whether services is 
still running, and restart it if not. You'll need to have atheme-services 
binaries and data installed in the same directory for this to work 
without modification.

First rename the etc/atheme.cron.example script that is in Atheme path (by default, 
~/atheme/) and edit it. You'll need to modify the "cd" part of the file.
Then ensure that the file is marked as executable by typing
"chmod +x atheme.cron.example" and try to launch the script to see if it works.

When this is done, you'll have to add the crontab entry. Type "crontab -e"
This will open the default text editor with the crontab file. Enter the
following (with correct path):

*/5 * * * * /home/nenolod/atheme/etc/atheme.cron.example >/dev/null 2>&1

The */5 at the beginning means "check every 5 minutes." You may replace
the 5 with other another number if you want (but less than 60). Save and exit,
and it's installed.

6. COMPILING THE CONTRIB MODULES
--------------------------------

In the Atheme source there is a directory called contrib filled with
all sorts of modules that are not included in the main modules directory
for one reason or another. Compiling these modules is very simple.

A README for what each contrib module does is at modules/contrib/README .

Simply pass the --enable-contrib switch to the configure script like so:

			$ ./configure --enable-contrib

The contrib modules will then be in your atheme install directory (by default
this is ~/atheme/) in the modules/contrib directory. you can then load them on a live
network like: "/msg operserv modload contrib/os_kill" or in your atheme.conf
by adding a loadmodule line like: loadmodule "modules/contrib/os_kill";
