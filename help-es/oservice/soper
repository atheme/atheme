Help for SOPER:

SOPER allows manipulation of services operator privileges.

SOPER LIST shows all accounts with services operator
privileges, both from the configuration file and
this command. It is similar to /stats o &nick&.

SOPER LISTCLASS shows all defined oper classes. Use
the SPECS command to view the privileges associated
with an oper class.

SOPER ADD grants services operator privileges to an
account. The granted privileges are described by an
oper class.

SOPER DEL removes services operator privileges from
an account.

SOPER SETPASS sets or clears a password for services
operator privileges on an account. The password must
be already encrypted. The target user needs to enter
the password using IDENTIFY.

It is not possible to modify accounts with
operator{} blocks in the configuration file.
